An electrical carriage has been shipped to
Chicago from Des Moines, Iowa. It may
arrive to-day, and as soon as its storage bat
teries can be charged it will be sent spin
ning alont; the boulevards. It was built for
ordinary usage and it is said to have carried
12 people at a speed ot 14 miles an hour
and can run continuously for 13 hours be
fore the energy is exhausted. The motor
ued is rated at four-horse power, and
has an armature of the Siemens type with
special-wound coils. The prominent feature
of the carriage is the storage cells, 24 in
number placed in three sets of eight each.
The weight is said to be but 32 pounds per
cell audio yield three-horse power hours of
energy per cell.
The carriage ha a special gearing and a
ball and socket motion to the axle, while a
peculiar hub device allows for any obstacles
encountered. The motor is carried by a
framework underneath the body of the car
riage and is geared to the rear axle. The
steering device is attached to the front uf
the axle and is controlled bv a handwheel in
the front of the carriage. It is said to be
so delicate in action that the course of the
chicle can be altered bv a slight touch.
The switch for throwing the motor in and
out ot circuit is moved by the foot of the
one in charge. This carriage is said to have
ascended grades or 17 per cent without
severe strains.

GOOD BYE, HORSES I
Wagons May Now Be Run by
Electricity.
Chicago, Aug, 10.— A novelty in the
way of a wagon propelled by electricity
was seen on the streets of Chicago yes
terday. Some time ago President J. B.
McDonald, of the American Battery
company, purchased several patents
from William Morrison, of Dcs Moines.
Among other things was a park wagon
equipped with a small three-horse-power
motor and twenty-four-cell storage bat
tery. Yesterday Mr. McDonald fitted
the wagon with new batteries and gave
it a trial. With five persons in the
wagon it left the barn on Monroe
street and traveled to the company's
office. The run was made in twenty
two minutes, which was considered a
satisfactory, considering that the wagon
was delayed at a bridge and that fre
quent stops were, made on account of
the crowds in the streets down town.
It is calculated that the wagon can
make ten miles an hour easily with the
present motor and can climb any bill in
the city.

The Starrte*?.
"On the evening before the race eleven
competitors declared they would start, but
the next morning when the motocycles were
:ent on their tifty-four-mile run only six
wagons hael appeared at Jackson Park and
midway plaisance. These were:
"5 Duryea Motor Wagon Company,
Springfield, Mass., gasoline.
"7?De la Vergne Refrigerating Machine
Company, Now York, gasoline.
"18?Morris Salom, Philadelphia, elec
tric.
"18?M. Mueller Co., Decatur, ill., gas
oline.
"?!?R. H. Macy Company, New York,
gasoline.
"25?Sturges Electric Motocycle, Chicago,

"The owners of the electric wagons did
not start out with the idea of winning the
race. They were unable to arrange for sup
ply stations at different places along the
route and consequently could not get enough
power to run over the route to Evanston and
back. Dut they Intended to show that their
electric wagons could travel under all con
ditions us well as the gasoline motor ma
chines, anel they considered their test proved
the practicability of electricity for horseless
carriages.
"The three wagons which distanced all
competitors?the Duryea, Mueller anel the
Macy?were all ?f German make, with some
American improvements. They carried Im
proved Btnz motors, the Mueller wagon be
ing Imported direct from Mannheim, Ger
many. The De la \rergne wagon, which won
the first prl7o In the Paris-Bordeaux race
lest June, also carried a* Benz motor, but
this falleil to drive the vehicle through the
deep snow at a satisfactory rate, and it
droppetl out of tho rage early."
Story of the liuryea Wajgon.
As already stated lie The Star, the Duryea
wagon won. The following is the story of
the Duryea's trip from Chicago to Evans
ton and back, as told, by A. W. White, Its
umpire:
"We left tho barn at 7:15 a.m. and went
with our own power to the starting point.
At 8:15 tbe start was made and we ran
without a stop to the corner of Erie antl
Rush streets. Here we broke our steering
gear ty running over a high crossing cov
ered with snow. A wait of fifty-five minutes
ensued. From this point we ran to Evans
ton without a stop, arriving there at 12*33
o'clock. On the return we were delayed four
minutes In Chicago avenue, Evanston, by a
sleigh that had tipped over In the street.
Cortlnuing, we got Into the wrong road on
account of the absence of a sign at the
corner of Lawrence avenue and Clark street.
We ran down Clark to Diversey street be
fore discovering cur mistake. Then we
went up Diversey to Lincoln avenue and on
Lincoln avenue to Roscoe street, where we
resumed the correct route. I estimate the
extra distance traversed at two miles, ap
proximate. While on Diversey near Clark
we broke our 'sparker,' and spent fifty-five
minutes repairing it. At 3:10 we resumed
the journey.
"We wore delayed fifteen minutes at
Drake avenue and Central Park boulevard
to adjust the machinery and to take fuel.
Another delay of four minutes occurred at
the Fort Wayne crossing of SRth street
boulevard. The delay at the second relay
was ten minutes. Numerous slight delays
of a minute or so I have not mentioned.
"Three and one-half gallons of gasoline
and nineteen gallons of water were con
sumed. No power outside the vehicle was
tsed. I estimate that enough power was
used to run the motor 190 miles over smooth
rof.ds. We finished at 7:18 and ran back to
10th street with our own power. Our cor
rected time was seven hours and fifty-three
minutes."

The Horseless Carriage.
It is not outside the realm of possibility
that in the century soon to dawn the
horseless carriage may be as familiar on
the public highway as the bicycle is to
day; as familiar, in fact, as the family con
veyance of the period. Of course' good
roads are a prime requisite for the success
of the motocycle, but good roads are
bound to come, and it is to be hoped that
the agitation for them that has been set
on foot all over this country will not be
void of desirable, results even before tha

clnse of the present century. Good
smoothly paved roads being a ccrtninty of
realization at no very remote date, "the j
i prospects of the horseless carriage seem to
j be quite flattering, if the judgment of the
fiiendsof the new invention" can bo relied!
upon. They contend that the horse may j
bo dispensed with and the highest measure
|of speed and comfort attained over j
smoothy paved boulevards in a vehicle pro
pelled by mechanical power. It is worth i
while to take a look at some of these up
to-date vehicles.
The "PJlectrqbat 1 is the original name
given by Morris Salom of Philadelphia j
to the first electric wagon constructed in i
that city. It was ihe joint work of a me-
chanical engineer and an electrician. The
i wagon was run hundreds of miles over
the streets of Philadelphia without seri- j
i ous mishap. Its tot.il weight, including
I the battery, is 4250 pounds, and the max;- j
mum mileage on one charge of electricity
la from h'fty to one hundred, according to j
speed and grades, the maximum speed at- j
tamable being- fifteen miles an hour.
Charles A. Duryea of Peoria, 111., ha 3

and rubber-tired wheels. It has an inge
nious mechanism for steering and changing
the speed without a moment's loss at time.
The cost of running this carriage is one
fourth of- a cent a mile, and a supply of
gasoline can be carried sufficient to nm
the machine 150 miles. Upon goo* roads
a SDeed of twenty miles is claimed.
There are numerous rivals for popularity
in the motocycle world. The Mueller
patent, for instance, recently won a prize
in a contest for economy of operation,
coming in a close seconci'to the Dnryea
machine. In order to stimulate invention
and do what they can to hasten the com
ing of the age of the marvelous carriage
the publishers of the Cosmopolitan, from
which publication the illustrations of
motocycles on this page are taken, offer
premiums amounting to $3000. These
premiums are to be awarded to motor
carriages presenting the greatest number
of points of excellence as exhibited in a
trial trip to be made from the New York
office of the Cosmopolitan on the 30th of
May to the Cosmopolitan building at
Irvington, and thence back to tbe starting
point.

THE day of the horse is passing
away. Already the practical de
monetlzation of the faithful!
equine might be said to be taking!
place, and before another cen- J
tury shall have elapsed he may have be
come a zoological curiosity. His yen- j
erable bones will be seen mounted and I
on exhibition in museums. The small
boy ot the twentieth century will won
der what sort of animal Equus cabal
lus really was and will marvel at the
Ca< t that he was once harnessed and
made to haul heavy loads.
The beginning: of the end was in sight
when electricity first supplanted the
horse as a means of propulsion for
street cars. Then the bicycle came,
sprang at once into popular favor and
rendered still more limited the' uses of
our once essential quadruped.
But now stili greater changes are
taking place. The introduction of the
automobile on streets of American cit
ies is slowly but surely driving out the
old fashioned hansom and the two horse
orougham, and now even the lorrie team
and the long overworked draft horse
are to become "things that were."
The recent formation of a company in
New York city with a capital of some
$100,000,000 to exploit compressed air as
a motive power for all trucking and
carting business in Greater New York
shows still again how surely the reign j
of the horse is passing away. He will
of course continue, for a time at least,
to remain the pet and the trained speed
ing animal of the wealthy in the city
and the helpful friend of the more hum
ble farmer in the country. But as time
goes on and urban population becomes
more and more dense it will be seen, to
be even more necessary in order to ob
viate congestion of traffic in city streets
and to maintain a proper degree of san
itation and cleanliness to allow only
self propelling- vehicles on the public
streets of our towns and cities.
The outcome of this will be a vast
Improvement in the condition and
smoothness of all city streets, the abo
lition of the objectionable cobblestone
is paving material and the elimination
of the ear piercing noises which now
make a pandemonium of the average
metropolitan thoroughfare.
It is true, motor vehicles for pleasure,
traffic and business purposes have been
somewhat slow of adoption in this coun
try. The horse has held his own here
with remarkable pertinacity, for it has
been in European cities, and particular
ly in Paris, that the automobile indus
try has flourished to the greatest ex
tent. The principal reason why Ameri
cans have been in no undue haste to
sulopt motor carriages re the fact that
mechanically these have not hitherto
been sufficiently developed to render
them acceptable for general use. The
motive power employed in most of them
has been unsatisfactory because of lack
of efficiency in some cases and extrava
gant expense of operation in others.
But American brains and American en
ergy have been at work on the problem
for the last few years, with the result
that the objections referred to have
been practically removed.
The general public, as a rule, has not
the opportunity of seeing the gradual
;:!:ti laborious approach to perfection of
any important mechanical invention.
This same general public is usually as
tounded at the miraculous appearance
i some new wonder, while the men
who have been laboring for years to
bring about this apparent mechanical
miracle foresaw the inevitable long be
fore the busy world had thought of such
a ihing. For some time now jokes have
been made about the passing of the
horse, but until the last year or so it
was never really thought that the pe
riod of equine usefulness had so nearly
approached its close.
It was vaguely felt that changes
might come about in time, for the idea
of mechanical instead of animal trac
tion power is as old as the history of
human thought itself. Even Homer
himself describes the god Vulcan as be
ing engaged upon the construction of
a great hall on wheels, which he de
.-cubes as "self moving and wonderful,"
and Juno is made to command Vulcan
to create tripods which shall run by
!v<>s. thus rendering better serv
!ce to the gods in their meetings on
Mount Olympus.
in the thirteenth century the English
philosopher Roger Bacon wrote in one
of his works. "They will make carriages
which will run with the greatest imag
inable swiftness without any harnessed
whatever."
The earliest horseless carriage which is
preserved today is one now on exhibition
in Paris at the Conservatoire dcs Artes
et Metiers. This machine was invented
by Cugnot in 1769 and was made to op
erate by steam, the energy of which
was applied through two perpendicular
piston tubes. The principal reason per- j
haps why the French steam automobile
was not brought to a state of compara
tive perfection during the last century
was the beginning of the revolution.
The turbulence which accompanied that
event naturally turned men's minds
from .peaceful and civilizing pursuits to I
thoughts of warfare and the deposing of 1
NUGGETS FROM EVERYWHERE.
Senator Simon of Oregon has been

running down his cheeks, said, "D'ye
tliink I could c;et the young beggar
ituffd?"
The late Senator Morrill, though he
monarchs. But it was in all likelihood
from the Cugnot steam carriage that i
Stephenson indirectly obtained his idea j
for a locomotive on rails.
j At the Exposition Universelle in Paris
I in 187S a steam automobile was exhibit-
I ed very like that of Cugnot, the only
j difference being that the frame of. the
j more modern vehicle was built after the
J plan of a common road carriage and not
jas a velocipede. This automobile, how- I
ever, was not a very satisfactory ma- j
chine, and it was not until 12 years later
that MM. Serpollet and Archdeacon in- i
vented a steam automobile, with which j
they journeyed from Paris to L.yons in
ten days. In 1894 the automobile first
gave promise of actual adaptability for j
general transportation and traction j
purposes. In that year the editor of the
Petit Journal organized the first auto
mobile race, which was run from Paris j
to Rouen. In this contest the steam
horseless carriage, while proving itself
cumbersome, noisy and uncouth in ap
pearance, showed itself superior to its
electrical and gasoline propelled rivals
of that time. The following year an
other race was run, this time from Paris
to Bordeaux and return, but in this test
it was the electrical carriage that prov
ed itself the superior machine.
Up to this time the construction of
these carriages had been conducted
along the ugly lines of a buggy or four
wheeled cart instead of seeking an in
dividuality for themselves through de
j signs more fitting to their peculiar qual
ities. Today, however, it might be said
that they have evolved an individuality
of their own. Automobile mechanics is
an art the nicety of which is only un
derstood by those who are of the pro
fession.
But one of the great difficulties that
still face the constructors of horseless
carriages is the problem of expense. A
Parisian made automobile victoria, for
instance, costs some $800 and an auto
mobile tricycle $300. The heavier car
riages are proportionately expensive.
This costliness of manufacture, how
ever, is a drawback that time will put
right,- just as has been the case with
the bicycle. But while the initial outlay
for an automobile Is still very large this
is more than compensated for by the in
significant extent of operating expenses,
the fuel for the petroleum propelled ye-
hides costing merely 1% cents per hour.
The development of the automobile as
a thing of beauty will take place only
when its place is assured and its use is
general, when people of means and
fashion will begin to demand certain
characteristics of design and finish to
differentiate their carriages from the
vehicles of the livery and the cab stand.

dies who have their own private auto
mobiles and may be seen any day
speeding noiselessly along the more
fashionable streets of that city. It takes
some skill and experience to operate
one of these powerful horseless car
riages, for, after all, they are mere lo
comotives and not unconnected with
danger in the hands of the inexperi
enced. In Paris the authorities require
each operator of an automobile to pass
a practical examination, after which
he is given a certificate of efficiency.
The local history of Paris, neverthe
less, .for the past two years has been
lively enough with runaways, collisions,
upsets and explosions of a more or less
serious nature. New York has also had
its list of little accidents.
There is one thing that the motor car
riage demands, and that is good roads.
We are already indebted to the bicycle
for an improvement in the condition of
our highways, but when the automobile
comes into general use both the great
unthinking public and governmental
bodies will become impressed with' the
necessity for a better class of roadmak
ing. As things now are, the United
States stands lowest on the list of ad
vanced countries in the matter of good
highways. Another advantage of the
use of the horseless vehicle will be that
our streets will be found more health-
customed to lay their books and pa
pers. "May it please the court," be
gan the diminutive counsel, when the
chief justice broke in, "Mr. Burnett, it

and silent generators *or storage batter
ies will do away with the roar of wheels
j and the rattle of horses' feet. In our
country, fortunately, there is no legis
lation and no popular prejudice against
I the automobile, as in England, for in
stance, where only a little over a year
i ago prohibitory legislation with regard
to the use of such carriages in London
was repealed. Until this action was
taken it was necessary that all horse
less carriages should be preceded by a
man on foot or on horseback bearing a
I red flag as a warning of the approach
of the terrible engine of destruction.
Animal power has ever been capri
cious and uncertain, while machinery is
j reliable and always sure. An automo
bile does not require continual atten-
tion, as does an animal. While not in
use the automobile entails no operating
expenses, and all that can be charged
to its idleness is the interest on the
original outlay for its purchase. Nor
will it grow old and die, like a horse.
When its day's work is done, it can be
run into a shed and stand there until
once more called upon to do service.
So long as it remaijis one of the deep
rooted characteristics of man, the most
restless of all animals, to be in the
place where he is not he will see to it
that his means of transportation are as
expedient, inexpensive and comfortable
as circumstances will permit. It has
taken him some time to reach the age
of the automobile, but it might be said
that such an age has at last arrived.
The passing of the horse furnishes
food for much profound thought and
reflection. It is a farreaching question, j
affecting almost all kinds and condi
tions of men. What will become of the
smith who hitherto eked out his frugal
existence in the wayside village under
the spreading chestnut tree? What will
become of the hay and feed man who
has so long and so profitably catered to
the inner wants of our old time equine
friend? What will become of the farm
er and his hay crop and his field of
oats? What will become of the costly
livery stable and the harness maker and
the veterinary surgeon?
It is no easy matter to figure out the
Immediate or even the ultimate im
provement in the general condition of
affairs which will result from the adop-
observed the speaker. "Suppose you
shut the door!" It is needless to add
that the passengers were comfortable
during the remainder of the trip.
A characteristic of the late William
Black was his ignorance of his own
books, and it was very difficult to get
him to talk about his novels. It seem
ed that as soon as the proof sheets were
returned to the printers Mr. Black for
got all about his own creations, "in
talking to my husband the other day,"
Mrs. Black once said fto a visitor, "I
suddenly remembered an anecdote in
one of his novels which illustrated what
I was saying. Mr. Black laughed hearti
ly at the story and then turned eagerly
lion of the horseless carriage, when it
is borne in mind that many disturbing
elements enter into the problem. Al
ready there has been a great falling oft
in the production ef horses and a depre
ciation in the value of horseflesh, which
i has filled the farmer and the horse
breeder with apprehension. But, for
tunately, these questions have the habit
jof settling and adjusting themselves.
j When it is remembered that there are
j now millions of acres of land devoted to
the growing of crops for horse food
alone, which in time may and must be
I devoted to the production of food for
I the human beings who are engaged in
the manufacture of the very machines
that are displacing the horse, the prob
lem is not so intricate and the outlook
is not so dark as it at first seems.
The poor old cab horse has always
had his drawbacks as a working ma
chine, and even with an animal en
dowed with all the noble attributes of
I the horse the question of economics can
not be kept out of the calculation. It
costs at least 60 cents a day to keep the
ordinary steed that travels up and down
a city's streets, and if he chances to be
a cab horse and times are good he will
I travel about 25 miles, on an average, on
that amount of nourishment. But he re
j quires at least eight hours' sleep and
rest, to say nothing of an occasional
day off as a result of colic, which leaves
I him a working capacity of 16 hours.
Most of the time, however, he spends in
j loafing around on street corners and
dreamily digesting his 60 cents' worth
of oats and hay.
It is commonly supposed that all cab
horses live about 100 years, but this is
one of those popular errors which have
no actual foundation in fact. His ten
ure of life averages, appearances to the
contrary, about 15 years, and at 60 cents
a day His feed in that time will amount
to only $3,275, for which, if he has
led an industrious, sober and unpam
pered life, he covers some 109,500 miles.
This newfangled automobile that is
elbowing its four footed rival off the
streets of the city, on the other hand,
will travel the same distance for about
$1,000, expended in fuel or electricity,
and while doing so will never have to
be sent to the blacksmith shop to be
shod, the average cost of repairs being
no more than that for the ordinary car
riage hauled by horses.
A French writer who has made a
study of the horseless carriage a spe
cialty has been figuring out its ultimata
to me, 'But where did you hear so good
a story?' My husband wouldn't be
lieve it was in one of his own books
until I found it for him."
Senator Frye of Maine says that
while in Paris he needed a hair cut, so
he studied carefully the necessary por
tion of his "French Conversation Book"
and did his best to make the barber
understand. "I don't understand Dutch,"
said the person addressed. "Do you
speak English?"
A good story is told by Rudyard Kip
ling at his own expense. During his
stay in Wiltshire, England, one sum
mer he met little Dorothy Drew, Mr.
Gladstone's granddaughter, and, being
possibilities and prophesying as to its
future.
He forecasts that the size of the auto
mobile, while not yet greatly differing
from the ordinary one or two horse
wagon, will increase in time to an enor
mous extent and that its weight may
even reach a Vegister of thousands of
tons. The liveryman will be replaced
by the dispenser of coal, electricity and
1 petroleum, and instead of water troughs
1 along the principal highways there will
be seen innumerable electric storage de
pots.
This French prophet attempts to
straighten out the economic knot by
1 forecasting that the horse will in time
become a delectable and much sought
after feod animal. He holds that a life
of leisure will restore the proper amount
of succulence to the flesh of the now
overworked quadruped, and that a time
will come when horse steaks will be
served at all restaurants and their con
sumption will be looked upon as a mat
ter of course. This Parisian prophet also
foresees the traveling shop and the itin
erant theater. An immense automobile
will carry along both actors, scenery and j
playhouse. On the upper floors of the
great wheeled building will be the
apartments of the company, who will
not have to pack and unpack their be
longings each day.
A train de luxe will become the fash
ionable means by which pleasure out
ings will be taken, and summer travel
ing will no longer be done on dusty and
crowded railway trains. A circuit court
will move from town to town in full
session on wheels, and even funeral
processions will consist of a number of
automobiles linked together like a train
of cars.
All this sounds more or less like a
page from a fairy tale book or the idle
dream of a mere visionary. It repre
sents, nevertheless, something far more
substantial, for it is the conviction of a
farseeing and scholarly French scien
tist, who has had the opportunity of
studying the different inventions which
are slowly but surely being brought to a
state of perfection in his own country,
which may well be called the birthplace
and the home of the horseless carriage.

THE BALLAD OF THE AUTOMOBILE
Oat of the woods and Into the stress ot Gotham marts there
came
Young Timothy Hay and began straightway to dicker with
Life for fame
And he cared no whit on thrones to sit or at shrines of art
to kneel
One aim alone before him shone to possess an automobile
He had a scheme like an opium dream constructed on
Midas plan
To wake up the world as it never was woke since Its slow
old life began
By the wheels in his head and the wheels on his feet he
conned the busy I atcs
And slid along the road to wealth as one on roller skates
He bought his treasure and mounted the seat and gazed
across the land
And felt with Joy t he marveloue toy obey his untried hand
And when he yaw 1 he ehauffeor wait to take him all about
He said I know what I want to do and you mayB well
get out
The chauffeur lit with alacrity ho had seen such things
before
And the automobl le on its silent wheel sptd like the days
of yore
And lest in dream s sat Timothy until cf a sudden he
Became aware that his agile charge vas trying to climb a
tree
Now what he said as he felt of his head I should not like
to say
No bicscle skates or electric car had treated him that way
0 he sat him dovv n beside the rocd to sec what the mat
ter might be
The machine mus t be out ct order he ijoth theres
nothing the ma Iter with me
He set the siecrliis rod nor-nor-cast and physicked tho
running gear
And what he did to the gasolene tank It doth not jet ap
pear
And the hair of the horrified cows rose up as they gazul
across tho fence
Tor the air was bluo with the slzzing smoke and language
most intense
Then he hoisted the vreck on it3 limping wheels and man
aged to make it go
Though its progress was somewhat erratic and tircd llko
and slow
And people gave It nil of the road when they saw It com
ing by
Till it reached the brow of a little hill and started out
to lly
Ho pounded the brake and he cried Cecl Haw but it did
not understand
And It turned unlimited somersaults across the startled
land
But though he was tumbled upside dovn in a most unseemly
way
Nobody saw a conviction of sin shaken cut of Timothy Hay
He picked himself and the automobile frcifl the mud of the
roadside ditch
And ihc state of the two was such that jou could hardly
tell which from which
And he said It Is all this darnel machine as cti can
plainly see
For all my tinkering did no good and terc3 nothing the
matter with me l
c
There came a buzz frcm the Lattcred Tiling a he climbed
to his seat once mure
And he rose on the wings of a purple cloud and a dull and
smothered roar
For whether it wa3 that the insult biiimned its passions
Mtter cup
Or what was the matter nobody knows but that automobile
blew up
A reeking smell of gasolene went forth and smote the
sky
The automobile and Timothy went on to the by and by
They were subdivided so thoroughly that not till the next
days rain
Did aught descend that was recognized as relics of the
twain
Now while to run an automobile Is a Joyous thii to do
The joy is done and no more it is fun when the sutomoblle
runs vou
And its btst to know where the rivets go and every cog

ceivers are bonded for FJOO/OO each. The Hartford
Rubber Works Company, which his a claim <-f
$11,785 60. was the petitioner. Inability to get
ready cash is said to be the cause of the Electric
Vehicle Company's trouble.
Juris* Cross adjudged the company to be in
solvent because it had defaulted in the payment
of 52,600,000 of 6 per cent gold bonds which ma
tured on November 1. The indebtedness consists
of these bonds, secured by mortgage on property
of the company held by the Morton Trust Com
pany, of New York: notes aggregating $899.r».l SO
and accounts payable amounting to EM.?!*) 3:2.
The assets are. placed at $14,054. 432 48. Of this only
$12,000 Is In cash, Die rest consisting of the plant,
patents, stock, accounts payable, etc.
Judge Ward, in the United States Circuit Court
here, also appointed Halsey M. Barrett a receiver
and William S. Montgomery, of this city, receiver
of the property of the Klectric Vehicle Company.
The bond of the receivers here was fixed jointly
at $25,000.

Hundreds Unable To Find
Seats In New Audi
torium
FIRST METHODIST
ALSO IS PACKED
Rev. Gid Higginbotham
Preaches At Extra
Meeting
Hundreds were turned away
Sunday night at the municipal
auditorium, where 'John Brown,
evangelist, began the second week
yf his revival campaign.
Fully an hour before the services
started great throngs commenced
noving toward the building, and by
7:20, ten minutes before the choir
opened its first hymn, every seat in
;he house was taken.
Besides this number, scores who
slipped through the entrance before the
capacity mark was reached, etood
throughout the meeting. With the
number seated on the speaker s plat
form it was estimated that the gath
ering totaled around 7,000.
Rev. Mr. Brown, sensing the overflow
early in the evening, ordered a special
sermon at the First Methodist church
where the Rev. Gid Higginbotham, one
of the Brown party, substituted for the
evangelist. Several hundred attended
this service.
Most df the crowd apparently came
in automobiles for the {jars parked on
Lhe blocks around the theater extended
as far as Fifth avenue, Eighteenth
and Twenty-fourth streets. It was the
largest body that has appeared at the
auditorium since it was built, attesting
Lhe prediction by Mr. Brown that Bir
mingham is verging upon the greatest
religious revival in its history.
•‘Repent’* Is Ills Theme
Mr. Brown’s sermon, as has been his
•ustom many times previous, was leveled
at the churches. He took for his sub
ject an old-fashioned plea for repent
ance, and his chant “Repent—repent
repent” beat as waves upon the ears
of his auditors.
In his pleadings for repentance Mr.
Brown selected for his attack tongues
and “dirty” money. He asserted the
tongues of scandal-mongers are a men
ace to any community through theii
disruption of character; tha tongue*
pf the suggest ivo story-teller n danger
ous threat upon morals, andared no man could hope to gain en
trance to heaven who died holding
“dirty” money.
“The time of Christ’s second cominig
is at hanad,” the evangelist said, "ant
whether you be “pre-millennary” 01
“post-millennary” you should prepare tc
meet your God. Any day He will come.’
Mr. Brown stated that the prepara
tion must first come through the
church; through the church from the
the home; and through the home froxr
the individual. “And the time for
churches to begin their preparation i*
now,” he said.
Lambaste Scandal Mongers
In an offensive against scandal
monging tongues Mr. Brown at times
reached passionate heights of oratory
that swayed his audience. Again when
he broke into an Indictment of “dirty
money audible sighs ran through the
crowd. While speaking upon the latter
subject, he became particularly bitter.
“Any man who has taken dirty money
and makes no honest effort to return
It Is as sure to reach hell as I am to
meet my Master on the Judgment Day,*1
he said. “I would prefer tp be penniless
and retain my soul.
“A man who Is in debt should try
conscientiously to pay what he owes.
If he religiously tries, he will receive
Divine aid.”
Mr. Brown said that Birmingham waa
entering upon the greatest religious re
vival in its history and he pleaded
with church members to put their
“house in order" and “straighten their
paths” to meet this epoch. He asserted
that the world had never been in a
greater need of religion and that the
golden opportunity to act now awaits
Lhe churches.
After reading from the third chapter
of 8t. Matthew, the minister chose parts
of verses two and three as his text:
"Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven
Is at hand”; and “Prepare ye the way of
the Lord. Make His paths straight. He
declared that “repentance” has never
been a popular or acceptable doctrine.
The evangelist stated that John the

been a favorite sermon topic
with Rev. Elder Love, negro, of
Selma.
He treated the subject with aplomb
throwing In just enough threats of'
hell-fire and damnation to keep his
audience resting uneasily on the eldge
of their seats.
Rev. Love had been booked to carry
his message befors a large gather
ing at the St. James A. M. K.
church Sunday evening. Feeling the
import of the mission he had dressed
with scrupulous care. He wore a
light blue suit, a light blue coat, a
light blue hat. and a necktie that
corresponded it, too, was light
blue. Several of the congregation
commented to each other regarding
the sartorial splendor of Rev. Love’s
attire but none took a greater genuine
interest that Houston Pickett. 1321

glance at the Rev. Love, draped
artistically upon the platform, and

second chapter of his scathing de

called to. the rear of the church. The
congregation waited restlessly sev
eral minutes for his return and then
appeased their religious appetites by
singing hymns.
While this was transpiring Rev.

languishing morosely in a cell at the

Monarchist Politicians
Believe Time Is Ripe
For Dictatorship
(Leaned Wire to Age-Herald.)
BLR LIN, Jan. 11.—President Ebert
In contemplating nominating a dicta*
tor to govern Germany, according to
the “Montag Font.” If Ebert should
adopt thin procedure he would pro
rogue the relehntag and send it home.
The president han given considera
tion to this most drastic step because
German politicians have been unable
to form a cabinet.
BERLIN, Jan. 11.—Vague ru
mors of a threatened revolution are
keeping over Germany. For more
than a month the leading middle
party politicians have been endeav
oring to form a cabinet. No cabinet
has b$en formed, and Germany is
getting restless. If the farce con
tinues for another fortnight, there
are reports that both the com
munists and monarchists would like
to take advantage of the popular
dissatisfaction with a “Putsch.”
The hints of revolution are vague
and may be groundless, but the mere
fact of their circulation tends to dis
turb the economic recovery that began
with the adoption of the Dawes plan.
Reds See Opportunity
Some monarchist and semi-monarchist
politicians would like to experiment
with a dictatorship. Meantime, the
reds think the time is opportune to
stir up the proletariat. The commun
ists however, are more inclined to bide
their time, hoping that If the elements
of the right attempt a coup, they may
receive a stupendous setback which
will make the abortive Kapp revolu
tion appear as nothing in comparison.
Contrasted to these extreme cliques,
the average German wants peace and
the order that deserted Germany along
with the otherwise unlamented Honen
zoUerns. Because Germans do y®®-™
for order, many observers suggest that
a monarchist coup at this time, with
its pVomlse of a return to “the old days
When everything was In order, might
attract considerable sympathy.
Nation Frets
The unending and farcial efforts of
the politicians to build a cab.net from
the material afforded by the elections
in December are fretting Germany.
Chancellor Marx having
Finance Minister Luther now is
toying with the cabinet business, al
though he has not been given an offi

for public inspection.
Luther's chances are doubtful, al
though the nituation la in a flux and
has been for month, making state
ments as to the future almost guess
work. To outsiders, the fact that a
month’s efforts have failed to produce
a cabinet appear ridiculous, but It has
its unfortunate side since the national
restlessness may result seriously.

Dr. Davlfi Jones Evans, pastor of the

tonight told the Sunday Evening club
here. Christ, the speaker said, ignored

the tolls of tradition. He declared that
man was above even the Sabbath and
presented to the world the greatest ideal
we have of human society. Plato’s re
public was a "hoble example of Greek
thinking, Moores Utopia was a great
example of English thinking and "look
ing backward" is a fine example of
American thinking, but Christ presents
the Kingdom of Heaven, which is the
highest example of universal thinking
that we know of.”
Dr. Ernest Freeman Tittle stated that
evolution rightly understood Is a sup
port for religious faith.
“The man who wrote the story of
creation,” Dr. Tittle said, “never
lokoed through a telescope or a micro
scope. He was not writing it to secure
a doctor’s degree at the University of
Chicago, yet In spite of the unscientific
age in which he wrote, he would prob
ably start the story the same, if he 1
lived now with all the latest knowledge I
at his command.

Give As Their Reason
That Reduction Has
Not Been Put In Force
In All The Cotton
Plants In The City.
Other Factories. Resume
Operations After Long:
Shutdown Textile Coun
cil Had Approved Cuts.
Fall River, Mass., Jan. 12. Three
hundred weavers employed la the Da
vie Mill here walked out this morn
ing in protest against a wage reduc
tion of ten per cent accepted by the
textile council last week. They gave
as reason for their action that the
reduction had not been enforced in
all mills in the city.
Give Their Reasons.
Spokesmen for the weavers said
that the ten per cent wage cut had
not become effective at the Parker
and Lincoln Mills, which are en
gaged in simHar work. Treasurer Is
rael Brayton of the Lincoln Mill said
that the reduction had been made
at that plant but that confusion had
arisen because the rate of pay varies
with th$ grade of goods manufactur
ed. The Barnard Manufacturing
Company reported thpt its weavers
objected to the reduction, but the
situation at other mills was quiet.
Work Resumed.
Flint Mill No. 2 resumed work to
day after a shutdown of fourteen
weeks, giving employment to about
200 persons. The Pocasset Mill which
had been running full time for sev
eral weeks was complelled to shut
down because of a break in the pow
er plant. This mill employs 600.
Tho SeacOnnet, Chace, Stafford, Ark-
wright and American Linen Kills,
which have been idle for several
months, failed to j-eopcu'with ho"e
dticed wage s'calo and ho increase of
employment whs reported at any eft
tho other plants, production was es
timated at C5 per cent of normal.
The wage cut was proposed by the
Fall River Manufacturers associa
tion and accepted by the textilo coun
ell, representing the six principal
unions of operatives. Unions affili
ated with the United Textile Work
ers of America have not accepted It.
A similar wage cut, proposed by the
New Bedford Cotton Manufacturers'
association to become effective next
Monday will be voted on this week
by the textile unions of that city.

CLEVELAND HAS
SOLVED CITY
TROUBLES
Party Organizations Have Been Eliminated and the City
Manager Plan Substituted —No More Election
Squabbles and Petty Political Fights—New Gov
ernment Based on Common Sense,
By FELIX F. BRUNER,
Editor The Indianapolis Times
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan. 12.—Cleveland has solved the
city government problem with which Indianapolis still is
struggling. It has done away with party organization in the
operation of the affairs of the city and has put them on the com
mon-sense basis used by other large business institutions.
While'the plan is admittedly not perfect—as no govern
mental plan ever was—citizens of this city are sure that it is far
superior to the old party system under which Cleveland suffered
as mueh as Indianapolis now is suffering. 9
The plan has done away with the party elections—which
never had any place in city government —and has made effi
ciency and ability the characteristics of city management. It
has done away with party conventions, such as the spectacle In
dianapolis will witness Friday; and it has done away with con
tinuous fights for party leadership, such as the one that now is
being waged in the Marion county courts and such as the ones
that will inevitably follow.
City Manager Plan
The Cleveland plan is THE CITY MANAGER PLAN OF
GOVERNMENT.
This plan is simple and is based on COMMON SENSE and
not political expediency.
The plan is that under which large business corporations
operate and it was adopted by large business corporations be
cause it is the BEST plan.
Briefly, Cleveland is governed by a manager and a board of
directors. The manager is employed by the board of directors.
The board is elected by the people of Cleveland in a non
partisan election. It is known as the city council.
So far as the administrative and legislative branches of the
government are concerned, the city councilmen are the only
elective officials.
A City Council
In Cleveland, the council consists of twenty-five members,
each of whom receives SI,BOO a year. This council elects a city
manager, who is executive head of the institution. He selects
department heads. There are no boards in Cleveland, such as
the board of safety, board of works, park board and board of
health in Indianapolis. These departments, and others are
looked after by department heads, just as they would be looked
after in any other business institution.
Cleveland pays its city manager $25,000 a year. The job is
a big job for a big man and necessarily must carry a compara
tively big salary, just as the head of any other corporation the
size of Cleveland or of Indianapolis would receive a big salary.
The Cleveland manager—at the present time he is W. R.
Hopkins, a native of Cleveland and a man of wide experience—
names these department heads
x LAW DIRECTOR, corresponding to the Indianapolis
corporation counsel.
PUBLIC SERVICE DIRECTOR, corresponding to the
Indianapolis board of wbrks.
Safety Director
PUBLIC SAFETY DIRECTOR, corresponding to the'
Indianapolis board of public safety.
DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC UTILITIES, who is the head
of municipally owned utilities, of which Indianapolis at this
time has none.
FINANCE DIRECTOR, corresponding to the Indian
apolis city comptroller.
WELFARE DIRECTOR, corresponding to the Indian
apolis board of health.
DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROPERTY AND PARKS,
who has duties similar to those of the Indianapolis park
board and who, in addition, is the custodian of all public
buildings and grounds, a duty divided in Indianapolis
among several departments.
TRACTION COMMISSIONER, who represents the City
in its relationship with transportation‘systems. The Ohio
public service commission has no control over local trans
portation systems as has the Indiana commission.
Under the Cleveland plan, the city council initiates public
policies, just as a board of directors initiates the policies of a
corporation, and the city manager, with his department heads
and their subordinates, carry them out.
In addition, Cleveland has a mayor, who is a member of the
council. He has very few powers, his principal job being that of
custodian of the “gates of the city.” He is referred to here as
the city’s glad-hand expert, the city manager confining his time
and energies to the city government,
