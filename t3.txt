stars of the Russian court circles. Is the
son of a poor peasant and belongs to
the "Chlysty" order of austere preach
ers who flagellate their bodies and
preach privation as the only method of
expiating sins. Seven J cars ago he ob
tained the patronage of a Russian
countess, and with her aid he rose to
his present position by a very clever
ruse Complaining to the countess that
his name, Rasputin," which means
"rake." was not befitting so holy a man,
he begged her to get him an audience
with the Czar to obtain permission, to
change It The audience was granted,
and so was his request the ruler of
all the Russlas ordering that he should
henceforth be known as "Gregory JJovj."
Rasputin made a deep Impression upon
both the Czar and Czarina on account
of his marvelous memorj. He can re

heart and lnvarlajilj answers questions

RUSSIAN
THE ABSOLUTE
MS RO FCZAR
CLAIMED THAT NO GREAT EU
ROPEAN COURT IS NOW UNDER
SUCH MYSTIC SWAY AS IS EM
PEROR NICHOLAS.
BY ASSOCIATED PRESS.
London. July 26. The mystic pea-
sant-born Russian monk Gregory Kas
Putin, on whom a murderous attack
was made by a woman while he was
visiting hU home in a Siberian village
recently. Is described by the St. Iet
ersburflr correspondent of the Dally
Chronicle as "the absolute master of
the Russia It Is certain that no
great European court today Is under
such a mystic sway as that which
Rasputin has been reputed to have
over Emperor Nicholas of Russia and
the whole imperial household. It has
been the concern of Russia for three
years back.
The rise of Rasputin has been as
enigma to all the nobles of the court
who have not fallen under his in
fluence. His absence from St. Peters
burg', during which the attack upon
him came, was hoped to mean that he
had fallen into disgrace, but just pre
vious to the news of his being stab
bed, the announcement was made that
he had been recalled to the emperor's
palace.
This modern Richelioi?, is the son
of a fairly wealthy peasant of To
bolsk. He had but little schooling
and led an uneventful life until about
thirty years old, when he developed
religions fervor, became a lay monk
and went on a pilgrimage. At the
monasteries he visited, he picked up
some learning and also managed to
receive a letter of introduction to
Bishop Theofan at St. Petersburg.
This was In 1900. Through the in
fluence of the bishop, the peasant be
gan to meet the influential people of
the city and court. His mystic phil
osophy created interest, ami lie nad
the gift of repartee and polite con
versation. At first Rasputin stuck to his pea
sant garb, in which he made a pic
turesque figure. But soon lie took up
an elegant style of dressing and liv
ing, which excited the envy of Bish
op Theofan. Tho bishop obtained an
order to exile Rasputin to Siberia. But
not only did Rasputin's appeal to the
Tsar save him, but caused the bishop
to be dismissed to Poltowa without
even time to see his dying father.
Other powerful officials tried to
check the advance of Rasputin only
to find themselves in disfavor. Ras
putin become the intimate of Use royal
family, gave orders to the ministers
and conducted himself as the supreme
power.
Tho only successful attempt to in
duce the court to send Rasput in away
resulted disastrously for the plotters.
Before leaving, Rasputin warned the
empress that misfoioine was bure to
follow. When the heir to the throne
fell ill, the frightened empress recall
ed the favorite in haste.
Since his return. Rasputin's power
has continued to grow. His counsel
is called for in deciding every ques
tion of Importance. It is said on high
authority that he brought about t!ic
ministerial change last year that saved
Russia from a war with Australia. He
lived as a prince, with a magnificent
vilia at Yalta, in Crimea. Ore of his
daughters by his peasant wife id be

college in St. Petersburg and is chief,

HERESYCASE
OE WIDE NOTE
TO BE REVIVED
THE FAMOUS "KIKUYU CONTRO
VERSY WILL BE REOPENED
AT MEETING OF CONSULTIVE
BODY ANGLICAN CHURCH.
BY ASSOCIATED PRESS.
London, July 26. The heresy case
of some months ago, known as the
"Kikuyu controversy,' is to be re
vived at the meeting here of the Cen
tral Consaltive Body of the Anglican
church. It was to this body that the
Archbishop of Canterbury referred the
charges brought by the Bishop of
Zanzibar against the missionary
Bishops of Uganda and Mombasa, Af
rica, for administering communion to
non-conformists.
The controversy 4s largely one of
church discipline, but involves the se
rious question of high and low church.
The low churchmen defend the Afri
can bishops in holding service with
and giving commanion to members of
the Presbyterian, Methodist and otner
n on -conformist sects, since they look
forward to amalgamating with these
bodies. But the high church party
says that such, communion is impos
sible because of differences in doctrine
and therefore stands in the way of a
union of the Church of England with
the Greek and Roman Catholics in a
single Christian church.
The consultive body will place its
findings with the Archbishop, as pri
vate of England, who will pronounce
judgment later.

DOOM OF THE ARISTOCRACY
One of the Promised Results of Great
War in Europe.
Speculation as to the effect of the
war upon the European monarchies is
most fascinating, especially to Americans
who have an ingrained suspicion
of every form of government save theix
own. There are many who maintain
that it is a war of dynasties, entered
upon for territorial greed or because
of animosities of the reigning houses.
The Hapsburgs are fighting to extend
their boundaries toward the Aegean, the
Hohenzollerns have dreams of world
dominion and the greater glory of their
name; the Romanoffs are seeking to
maintain their hold upon the loyalty of
the Slavs outside of their empire and
to bind them more closely to St. Petersburg
so that the ultimate extension
of the Russian frontier to the Mediterranean
may be facilitated.
There is no doubt that these are
among the potential reasons for the
conflict. Hut they are not all the reasons.
The German army is not merely
the kaiser's lighting machine. It is
Germany in arms. When 5,000,000 men
respond to the call to the colors, or
stand ready to respond, to carry out
the plans of the kaiser, it is pretty safe
to assume that the cause of the kaiser
is the cause of Germany, and that national
as well as dynastic reasons lie
behind the great enterprise. The same
reasoning will apply to Russia and to
Austria only to a lesser degree. Germany
and Austria are in alliance because
of their common interests. They
both seek an outlet to the Aegean and
to the markets of the east. The dynastic
policies are supported by the
commercial interests of the two em

zollerns and the Hapsburgs art- the
spokesmen for and leaders of their
people and are leading in the direction
in which they would go.
There is no dynasty in France to be
glorified, but the French people have
been arming for forty-four years for
this great conflict. The Frenchmen
who took their hoardings from their
stockings to help their government pay
the indemnity to Germany in 1870 have
been waiting for the opportunity to get
it back again, and their children have
inherited the same relentless purpose.
They have watched and waited nearly
half a century for this one great,
over-whelming, all-absorbing opportunity
of "revanche!"
Despite the fact that the ambitions
of the people and the dynasties are in
accord, the effect of the war upon monarchical
institutions will be momentous.
The spirit of democracy is
abroad. It has practically abolished
the British house of lords. It has forced
the establishment of a parliament
in Russia. It is so active and alert in
Germany that the Social Democratic
party is the largest and most powerful
political organization in the empire.
In France it overturned the monarchy
nearly half a century ago, and is now
so firmly established that only the
wildest dreamers ever imagine that republican
institutions can be displaced.
It is regnant in Portugal and nearly so
in Spain. A nation in arms, as Germany
now is, will not long be content
to remain a nation without a ministry
responsible to its parliament. The
democratization of German institutions
is inevitable after the war, whatever
the result. The people, even in Russia
are no longer driven serfs. They think
they reason and a demonstration ot
the power of 5,000,000 men on the battlefield
will not be lost on the patriots
who wish also to demonstrate the power
of the same number of millions in
deciding at first hand the causes for
which they will take up arms. Whether
the kings and the emperors remain
on their thrones matters little. Great
Britain, though it retains the fiction of
a monarchy, is as democratic as the
United States, and its parliament responds
with greater precision to popular
sentiment than the American congress.
The war means the end of autocracy

IS RUSSIA'S REAL RULER
Illiterate Siberian Monk Said to be
Power Behind the Throne in Czar's
Realm.
While Rasputin was visiting his
family recently in his native town of
Krekovksy, province of Tobolsk, Si
beria, a woman named Guseva plunged
a dagger into his abdomen. She wished,
she said, to put an end to the awful
evil wrought by this man in Russia by
his impostures and intrigues under the
guise of prophet.
Rut Rasputin will recover. And when
lie does, woe to his enemies! He
blames it all on Heliodorus, abbot of
Esaritsyn, whom Rasputin, by his inlluence,
drove from the imperial court.
Rasputin will live, he declares, in spite
of Heliodorus; and he will take a terrible
reckoning.
Since the spring of this year keenest
watchers of the Russian skies have
taken a second long look at Gregori
Rasputlin. This strange, quiet personality,
unobtrusive and yet conspicuous,
used to be the target mainly for scandal
mongers and for the vast number
of Russians who are disgusted at the
character of the dominant intluence
in the czar's household. Rut recently

The diplomats must glean

admit that the half illiterate Siberian
peasant exercises greater sway over
the mind of the czar and his sovereign
decisions than did the austere and exalted

Holy Synod, over the stern policy of
Alexander III.

Cregori Rasputin holds attention til
lirst sight by his remarkable nose and
eyes. His gait and his dress are those
of the devout, humble lay brother and
Scripture reader, which is the Russian
social type to which lie approximates.
Rut his large, strong, well-set nose is
that of a man of commanding will and
authority, and he has the large, bluegray
eyes of the seer who will not be
drawn into discourse on the plane of
ordinary mundane affairs.
Some men have a kind of magnetism
other than that which manifests itself
on the intellectual or spiritual side of
the personality. It may be exerted,
physically, in the form of animal magnetism,
in the "laying on of hands" to
allay nervous torture, and even in such
healing processes as osteopathy or
bone setting. The most competent objective
psychologists who have studied
Rasputin declare that he possesses this
animal magnetism to quite an amazing
degree, and that as a dynamic human
organism he is a phenomenon.
Much in Russian tradition favors the
periodic appearance of some such wizard
and soothsayer. These may be
charlatans for the most part, but now
and again they prove to be something
more. To say that the world has outgrown
them is quite erroneous as regards
Russia.
Among the scattered pastoral villages
around Tomsk, where Rasputin
lirst began to exercise his strange
power nearly twenty years ago, the
conditions of daily life and the vocabulary
in which the people exchange their
thoughts are not essentially different
from what they were two or three centuries
ago, nor so very different from
the early ages when a Peter the Hermit
could inspire a crusade.
None of Rasputin's followers thus
far, whether dupe or devotee, has come
fooiirnivl in hie hniir of L'rcnlnpsS to de
nounce him as an impostor. Such a
one would assuredly run no risk if he
did, for Rasputin is most cordially
hated both by the police and the press
censorship. To people familiar with the
habits of Russian life it would have
sounded incredible a year ago had they
been told that the government bureaucracy
and the radical intelligence
would ever agree on anything. Yet today
they are as one in their antagonism
to Rasputin.
In a recent Duma debate a much-respected
leader of the Liberals, Mr.
ICphremoff, declared "that the highest
affairs are settled in the highest
spheres by an obscene charlatan." The
press censorship allowed this to be
published broadcast, and the crown
prosecutor has taken no action. The
campaign against Rasputin is allowed
to proceed publicly on lines which
among decent Russians are far more
Biilnrarolvn i,f povepencp fur t h*> throne
than anything that is secretly circulated
from the revolutionary printing
presses.
The political hatred directed against
Rasputin is based on the fact that he
is the incarnation of irresponsible, oneman
power, the result being the absolute
repudiation not only of constitutionalism.
but of the actual administration
and bureaucratic system, or indeed
of any system at all. He has
checked, nonplussed and baffled the
clever men in the governmental machine
and the wily men in the Holy
Synod. In the duma, some weeks ago,
Mr. HilinkofT read a letter of the present
procurator of the Holy Synod, Mr.
Tabler, in which the latter thanked
Rasputin for allowing him to retain his
high office! Tabler denounced this as
malicious tattle, but he did not deny
the specific allegation.
The only minister of the czar who
showed open enmity to Rasputin was
Kokovtzoff, and Kokovtzoff had to go.
Wandering about the corridors of
Tsarkoe-Selo palace in felt slippers,
like the most intimate member of the
household, Rasputin waited for Prime
Minister Kokovtzoff to come out from
an audience in the czar's cabinet, and
said to him quietly:
"Well, how much hast thou stolen
today?"
KokovtzefT flushed angrily and moved
off, but he could neither say nor do
anything.
A few weeks ago a governess of the
czar's youngest daughters was standing
at their chamber door at bedtime.
Their father had gone into bid them
good night. Rasputin was about to
follow when the governess barred his
way, saying that the young grand
duchesses were retiring for the night.
Rasputin made no reply, but forbore to
enter. The czar, when he came out,
thanked the governess for her watchfulness
over his daughters, but in less
than a week she was given notice that
her services were no longer required.
Each step of Rasputin's progress has
been taken with the help of women
devotees. He has a quiet, well-modu
luted, "warm" voice, and uses at all
times the archaic "thee," "thou"
phraseology of the Bible?which sacred
book, except for a few simple devotional
works of the old Orthodox
church, is the only literature he has
ever read. First in western Siberia,
and later along the Volga, he used to
sojourn as Scripture reader in the
houses of the provincial merchants*
and others of the peasant class who
had prospered in a worldly way. These
men would often have money enough
to be able to indulge their wives in any
luxury, but the simple elementary
life in those remote districts provided
no means of relaxation. The women
would frequently drop into the state of
nervous depression which is the common
malady of idle rich womankind
the world over.
'I'lw.n frnm htillsolinli] til household
spread the rumRasputin.
the Scripture reader, had the marvelous
secret of dispelling this restless,
nervous feeling. Kastward from Moscow
he attained some fame as a "healer"
anion? bourgeois religious circles.
It was part of Rasputin's practice to
use absolute patriarchial directness in
his talk with his women followers, no
matter what the subject discussed
might be. The simple words he used
in relation to the elementary facts in
human life would sound coarse to cultured
ears. He believed, moreover, in
the "laying on of hands," and practiced
it literally. This reputation proved
nothing in his disfavor, and he advanced
into the more select circles as
the center of religious assemblages.
A lady of the Karnovitch family,
whose sister is now Countess Hohenfelsen,
murgantic wife of the Grand
Duke Paul, first brought Rasputin to
St. Petersburg. There was not much
pretense of religious pietj about her
salon, but the "healer" was cultivated
as a new diversion in a blase existence.
In fact, the guests looked on
him somewhat in the light of a spiritual
medium, although Rasputin has
always repudiated any suggestion of
"seances" or of hypnotism. His absolute
sway over many people, especially
women, and notably the empress,
and their passiveness under the spell of
his personality undoubtedly partake in
the broad sense, of hypnotism. Hut
Rasputin practices none of the hocuspocus
of the craft.
Rasputin's enemies charge that he
holds and makes silent use of certain
ambiguous messages from the empress
indicating his complete dominion at
the palace of the czar. He was introduced
there by iMme. Vyrbova, the wife
of a naval officer and the most intimate
of the empress' ladies-in-wait
ing. He goes two or three times a week
to the palace, remaining from morning
till night, and is sent for by telegram
whenever the court moves from one
place to another. In every direction
his influence is felt. The dowager em
press, however, is an avowed antlRasputinite,
and since the "monk's"
sway set in she has rarely seen her son
the czar, or her daughter-in-law except
at public ceremonies.
The crowning miracle of Rasputin is
this: He has moved the empress, who
for nearly twenty years that she has
shared the Russian throne has cared
for nothing outside of her domestic affairs
and who has not shown the
slightest intellectual curiosity about
anything, into an ardor of political interest
sympathetic to that in which the
czar is acting and working, neither
through his ministers nor the people,
hut through a Siberian peasant who
can scarcely write his own name?an
avowed mystery man who represents
absolutism incarnate. Neither the imperial
bureaucracy nor the elected legislature
has been able as yet to bring
Nicholas II., into definite light as a
reigning sovereign. And now, under
the will of a human enigma, behold
this same sovereign autocrat emerging
and asserting the authority that bewilders
alike the defenders and the
enemies of his throne!

It is a curious story, that of the

Not only dlil Nicholas take much

WHO IS RASPUTIN?

left for Russia, we asked him to
find out and write for us the real
truth about Rasputin, the mysterious
monk who is said to be the power
behind the Russian throne. Mr.
Kirtland was granted exceptional
facilities for securing information:
we believe his article to be the first
really authoritative statement of the
facts published in America. It is a
story of fascinating interest a figure
out of the fourteenth century influencing
the destinies of a twentiethcentury
nation. We shall see in the
next decade a mighty conflict between
the forces of progress in Russia,
strengthened by the present war, and
the forces that in the past have been
responsible for Rasputin and the
medievalism which he represents.
The Editor.
I MISSISD having dinner with Rasputin
by one day. Every intricate
detail had at last been arranged. Although
reported to lie visiting friends
in Siberia, Rasputin had come to Petrograd,
and was to have been motored in a
closed car to a private apartment for the
dinner. Since the attempt on his life, last
spring, in one of the exclusive eating
places of fashion, ho now never appears in
a restaurant.
For six weeks I had manceuvered,
reaching for this wire and theu for that,

uiuu iinany 1 Knew iiun i null me rigm
one?for in Russia every one ean be
readied by some wire. The point was,
to find the man whom Rasputin could not
deny, and then to find the man who could
bring pressure on that man. Fortuitously,
1 found that third man, and then I knew
that I was well ou my way to Rasputin.
And then, with the last detail completed,
1 was called away t wenty-four hours too
soon. By the space of that one day I
missed meeting the most interesting character
in Russia?the great, towering
monk, Gregory Rasputin, who from behind
the throne of Muscovy for the past
decade lias held in the mercy of his
power the dictation of the weal of the
Empire.
It is neither necessary nor discreet to
say who my acquaintance was, nor who
it was that knew Itaspntin. Emphatically
it is necessary to omit tolling the intrigue
of the pressure that was brought to
hear. But the man who knows Rasputin
1 is perhaps the only man who has ever
really known the monk intimately, and
who has ever been his confidant. He
promised to toll me, as a prelude to the
dinner, tho secret of just who Rasputin is,
and to reveal the mystery of how he arose
to his power.
To get to my informant's house I was
led from tho sunshine of the broad, roughly
cobbled street into a court-yard, and there
we found a door leading to a long tlight of
dark stairs. We climbed until just under
the roof, and nressed a hell. Ktons enme
and a door was unlocked. Wo slipped in
quickly, as if there were furtive eyes
watohing. Where the trail of Rasputin
reaches there is always clandestine slyness.
The man himself came to thedoor.
He pushed open a door and led us through
some rooms until we came to an inside of

He made a mockery of his superiors,
and victims of the women. When the
village grew too narrow a field for his
adventures,howandered awayas a pilgrim.
"Rasputin had never had a day of
schooling, and he had the direst ignorance
of anything that he might find in the
outside world, except what his priest had
told him of big cities with great churches,
and of monasteries and convents and holy
places. It was the betrinnine of an eduea
tion to make his way from village to village,
trying tho mettle and temper of strangers
with his questions and high spirits. You
can picture him when ho reached Moscow,
tramping around and around the great
churches and palaces with open mouth
and staring eyes.
"He saw that men had done bigger
things in the world than he had ever
dreamed of. He docided that reading and
writing must have had something to do
with this power. A Rasputin does not
have to look long in this world for teachers.
He has had many. Amidst various hotblooded

the city and the art of the wonderful

of his uneouthness. The paradox of
it all was that Moscow was now a disappointment
to his new moods. Incredible
?yes; but this central Siberian moujik
was demanding something from the great
Moscow churches that they could not
give. Rasputin told his friends that the
church lacked passion. Their answer

to communicate with the m.iss of the people
from whom his exalted birth and rank
separated him. Kruni Itasputln. It Is said.
Nicholas learned of the horrors of vodka,
and Immediately set about to eliminate
them.
When Rasputin lay wounded In Tyumen
In 1914 his Majesty sent to him the court
physician, Professor Serglus Pctrovltch. It
was then that Rasputin mudo this startling
accusation against Illlodor, "the mad monk,"
who Is now In Now York:
"It Is all that cursed Illlodor. Hut, to
the confusion of hlmsolf and my enemies,
I will live, nnd they will have nooses put
round their necks."
When Interrogated, the Gusevu woman
declared that she had attempted to kill
Rasputin because ho had spread tempta
tion among the Innocent. No connection
could be established between her and
Illlodor.
SUSPECTED AS PRO-GERMAN
The attempted assassination of last
spring Is supposed to have been duo to
political causes. Rasputin had been well
autualnted with lit-neral W. A. Souk
homllnoff, who was Russian Minister of
War during the fatal campaign In East
Prussia, when traitors were believed to
have betrayed the Russian armies In the
field anil left them without reserves of
munitions at home. In Juno, 116, Souk
homllnoff resigned and was later arrested
end lodged in the fortress of Peter and
Paul.
Among the witnesses sought was Ras
putin, who wus known for his pro-German
sympathies. It was said that he
had been discovered by the secret po
litical police and would create u Bensu
tion at the trial. Ueforo lie had a chanco
to tesllfy, however, ho disappeared. Then
came tho news of his assassination from
Bucharest, which, however, proved false.
His long immunity from arrest as a wit
ness Is said to have been duo to a certuln
clique of the Ministry, who, if not actually
pro-German, were nevertheless working for
a separate peace looking to a desertion of
Kngland and France and a subsequent
treaty with Germany.
The completo reorganization of the Min
istry under pressure of the Czar nnd'-'Duma
alike, a month ago. changed all that. The
trial of SoukhomllnolT was ordered, nnd
Itasputln waa brought to Petrogrud. whero
he lived under police surveillance, ready,
It has been reported, to tell all he knew.
Tho Czar first met Rasputin in 1805
through tho Countess Ignatieff, wife of a
former Governor of Hlberla, and much In
terested In tho cult of the Chylsty's sect of
flaggellants. which Rasputin was trying to
revive. In the Countess's circle, where tho
Czar waa then an occasional visitor, wcro
the Montenegrin Princess Mllitza, wife of
the Grand Duko Peter N'ikulalevltch Prlnco
Putjatln. Court Marshal Count fieticken
dorff. Prince Orloff, and. finally, General
Soukhomlinoff.
It has been said that when tho wur began
the genuine Muscovites gradually droppt.il
away from tho rlrrlii, leaving only Ilaltto
Russians, with German IdeaB, behind, nnd
that the circle then became the center of
German propaganda to which tlrussilux re
ferred in April. 19 m, when he took com
mand of the southern Russian armies und

By HERMAN BERNSTEIN.
A
KV sensation has come from
Russia.
Itussla has long been fur
nishing new sensations to the world,
weird happenings In mcduevnl set
tings, grotesque and grim tragedies.
While the rest of the world kept nd
Tanclng Russia stood still. While tho
Russian people, yearning for light and
liberty, have prodyced works which
constitute the pride of Russia, the
Russian autocracy, even though It had
a constitution and parliament forced
upon it, has clung to medievalism
with all Its plcturesqucness, Its qualnt
tess, Its cruelties and Its horrors.
For the third tlmo in the last few
rears the story of the death of Ras
putin has reached America. This time
It is apparently true.
The story of Gregory Rasputin is
tinlque even among the strange stories
f the monks, mystics and fortune
tellers who surrounded the Czars of
Russia and Influenced their decisions
In matters of vital Importance to the
Russian people.
To the average Intelligent American
reader It may be Inconceivable that a
ereat empire like Russia, 'a people that
has Riven to the world great men and
women In literature, In art, in sclcncu
and In music, that has brought forth
some of the noblest and bruvest
martyrs for freedom, should bo ruled
In this age through tho Influence of
tharlatans, fortune tellers, weather
prophets, mad monks and Illiterate
peasants. But when it Is recalled that
only a few years ago the mcdlan-al
fi'ual murder myth was staged In tho
ancient city of Kiev In the form of tho
WIN affair, when It Is recalled that
wly a few years ago pogroms wore
WKamzed in many cities and towns In

1 surprising that the ruler of '.ho
Umpire- should be Influenced
'nj Raided by oil sorts of "saints" and

Those who know anything nt nil

'act that some of these powers behlrd

tan: Ukhtomsky-Aslatt-ky, who fired
the Czar's Imagination with Ideas of
his great historical mission: Pero
Philippe, the hairdresser of Marseilles,
spiritualist and healer; a girl named
Gulatzky, who was tho Czar's favorite
ndviser for a time; Bezobrnzov, who
was raised from titter obscurity and
mado Secretary of State; Father John
of Cronstndt, the mad monk Illodor
and Gregory Rasputin.
The strangest of them all was un
doubtedly Philippe, the barber of Mar
seilles, who used to call for the Czar
the spirits of his ancestors and ask
their advice concerning family mat
ters and affairs of state. As long as
he remained In the palace of the Czar
Thllippo was the most powerful man
In Russia, and his Influence In nffalrs
of the gravest Importance was greater
than that of the Premier or other
members cf the Cabinet. Without his
approval nothing was dono by the
Czar.
nnf ThlMnn prpn' tnn bold in his
deceptions one day nnd he was re-
placed by the Gu'ntzky girl. During
the Russo-Japanese war she predicted
that Russia would meet with defeat i
unless
is the Czar himself went to the
Th. rv.ir was on the nolnt of 1
front
taking the girl's advice, but Count
Wltte, Kuropatkln nnd Pobyedonost
seff dissuaded him with great dllllculty
and he remained at home.
Bezobrnzov and Alexeyev, the latter
'gestlon, were practically responsible
for the outbreak of tho war between
Russia and Japan, j
Father John of Cronstndt appeared
upon the scene nt a time when Intrigues I
were helntr engineered for the purpose
of causing the Czar to dlvorco Alexan-
dra Feodorovna because she had
brought him no male heir to the Rus
sian throne. Father John told the
Car of n newly discovered saint in the
de.ert of Sarov and suggested n royal
procession to the desert. The head of
the Synod approved tho suggestion nnd
a royal procei-slon was organized to
visit the testing place or St. serapntm.
Suddenly, after a few years of se
crecy as to tho real Influences control
ling the Czar, tho name of Illodor, the
"Mad Monk," was mentioned.
This young monk became notorious
for his daring harangues against tho
progressive elements In Russia, against
the revolutionists and the Jews, whom
he denounced with vitriolic venom,
ca'.ling upon the populace to start ma
meres. Stories of his attacks upon
high dignitaries of the State and tho
Church reached thlu country at tho
time.
He defied the Holy Pynod nnd ip
no red the commands of the Procura-
tor; he travelled about Russia preach
ing arrogantly against the Church, nnd
nt the same time Incited the mob to
riots and to massacres. Liberal Rus
sia was puzzled. No one could under
stand why this firebrand was per
mitted to carry on his propaganda of i
anarchy.
Victor Obnlnsky, a prominent mem-1
ber of the first Duma, one of tho ablest
men In tho Constitutional Democratic
party, In his Important book, entitled
"The New Order In Russia," published I
in Moscow In 1909, said this of Illodor;
"Tho events of 1905 did not separate i
the State from tho CJiurch. In the
practical twentieth century life did not
bring forth In Russia any clergy who
were not afraid of Independent views,
nnd the types of Nikon and Philippe 1
havo degenerated Into the Illodors and
the Vostorgovs.
"After the dispersion of the first
Duma the Synod prohibited tho clergy
from touching In their sermons upon
any question relating to the political t
condition of the country. Tho circular
of the Synod on this subject stated
that In case the people desired to hear
from their priest as to whether the
conuttions oi too peasants wuum im
ameliorated, the priests should arrange
private discussions, pacifying tho pop
ulatlon, telling tho peasants that the
Czar understood tho needs of the peas
antry and would Improve their condi
tion before long. The manifesto an
nouncing the dispersion of the Duma
was to be read with an appropriate
explanation.
"Nevertheless, the churches were
turned into political arenas. Bishop
Nazary of Nizhni Novgorod ordered
the tolling of tho bells In nil the
churches of that city on tho day tho
Duma was closed, and sermons were
delivered In which the Jews were at- i whero a massacre of. Jews occurred

fihonko in his sermon declared that i when Illodor commenced to attack
the JewB organized the revolution, j
lure organizing the assassinations and
nro pinnning to muraer mo neui uu-1
slun Doputles. The Union M the Renl
Russlans will adopt harsh measures
and will destroy tho Jewish Govern
ment.' "Another notorious priest, the
founder of a sect, lectured In St, Peters,
burg on '.The Jows in general n,nd po
groms in particular.' In that lecture
he made the point that tho Jews were
making pogroms against themselves
nnd lie Baw In such progroms tho
finger of God, who punished the Jowa
for their sins against the Government,
"But the record of fanaticism and
bigotry was broken by tho notorious

feared by the governors nnd police in
spectors of the regions in which this
turbulent Instigator of massacres ap
peared. Finally the archbishops them
selves began to nsk for the removal
of tho fanatic, but In vain, Instead,
Illodor was placed In tho very home
of the man who complained against
him, Anthony of Volhynla. Then
Illodor went to Rostov on tho Don,
the dlgnlturles of the Church who en
deavored to Interfere with his propa-
ganda the only bishop who upheld him
wna Germogcn, another' reactionary
who also becamo notorious In connec
tlon with pogrom propaganda. No ono
understood how tho young monk In
the face of such powerful opposition
was received by tho Czar. The press
of Russia devoted much space to Illo
dor's weird, eccentric talk, but no ono
knew at that tlmo that Gregory Ras
putin, the Illiterate Siberian peasant,
the new favorito of the Czar, was be
hind Illodor.
Rasputin und Illodor became Inti
mate friends. Rasputin had hoped to
make his influence over the Czar
permanent through his relations wtth
the "Mad Monk." He was Illiterate
SStttt
WHO
and he wanted some one who could
write out what he regarded as his re
ligious philosophy of life. Ho also
wanted Iliodor's assistance In his plans
to become the official father confessor
to tho Czar,
For some time Rasputin and Illodor
were close friends. Through Rasputin's
efforts tho "Mad Monk" was received
in audience by tho Czar and by the
Empress. Ho met them only once, for
a brief time, and they spoke to him
mainly about Rasputin.
The struggle for power and the de
slro to replace Rasputin In the favor of
tho Czar turned Illodor into Rasputin's
arch enemy. Knowing of a number of
Rasputin's escapades, Illodor resolved
to expose the "mint" Rasputin in
tho hope that he would be called to
take his place as spiritual adviser to
the Czar.
But Rasputin was the abler and the
cleverer of the two, and notwithstand
ing tho assistance of Bishop Ger
mogen Illodor failed in his efforts to
fhake the confidence of the Czar and
the Czarina la Rasputin. Illodor was
thrown Into prison. He escaped from
Russia on the day of the outbreak
of the war, clad as a' woman, and thus
saved himself from the hand of Ras
putin which" was 'stretching out to
crush him completely,
RULED CZAR
Gregory Rasputin, who reigned In
the ixalace of tho Czar about thirteen
years, was a mnn of powerful phys
ique, of extraordinary will power,
cunning and daring. All his acts, how
ever Immoral, he defended from a re
ligious point of view.
In his youth ho wns known as a
drunkard. He hnd a criminal record
nnd served n term in Jail many years
ago. After that he left his home and
disappeared for n long time. He come
back "reformed."
He said that religion had changed
his life. Ho became a pilgrim. He
walked through various parts of the
Russian empire begging for bread and
for shelter.
Tho story of the reformed Siberian
peasant spread through Russia and
finally reached the Czar through some
of the ladles of the court who had met
him. Rasputin was Invited to the pal
ace. Ills quaint religious viewpoints
made n profound Impression upon tho
Czar and the Cznrlna and his Influence
commenced little by little to dominate
the Russian empire.
M. Paul Mllukov, the leader of the
Constitutional Democratic party in the
Duma, mado the following statement
several years ago from the tribunal of
the Duma:
"Gregory Raspttttn, ths 'new one,' is

the same man who recommends
Premiers and removes Procurators of
the Synod, who helped illodor ngnlnfit
the Synod nnd the Synod against Illo
dor, and the man who Is helped by
Rasputin always wins."
One of the most characteristic in
stances hhowing to what extent tho
Czar was influenced by this corrupt
and Illiterate pensant "saint" occurred
In connection with the deoth of Count
Leo Tolstoy and the resolution of tho
church on that occasion. Tho Czar
mado public tho resolution prepared
for him, praying God to be merciful
to tho Chrlstaln Just departed. The
reactionary press of Russia song tho
Czar's praises, hut somehow the Czar
was not pleased with the order Issued
by the Holy Synod forbidding tho tra
ditional religious service at the Tolstoy
funeral.
Ho was not quite sure that the
rhti'ch haJ ih:-mi the light -ouiso In
tho matter. Instead of consulting the
foremost dig. iMtie.s o' the church or
the synod, he sent for his friend Ras
putin, who was In Siberia at the tlmo
In his homo village.
Gregory Rasputin, who not only
preached immorality but who was at-
tacked on several occasions by women I
ho had deceived, was summoned to
TsnrsUoe Kelo (n ndvlse the Czar with j
regard to lhe attitude of tho Russlon
Church toward the ex-communlcntlon
of Leo Tolstoy. A fellow passenger of
Rasputin's In the Siberian train relates 1
tho following conversation which took
place whllo Rasputin was hastening to
tho Czar. I
"This Is not my first visit to Tsar
skoe Solo," said Rasputin. "It Is truo
the members of the court party do not i
like me. But I pay no nttentlon to1
them. I am supposed to visit .the man
nurse or tutor of tho Czarevitch, but l
I nm ushered Into the Czar's room.
"I drink tea with the Czar and Czar
Inn, and we always talk n great deal.
Tho Czar has now sent for mo tq dis
cuss whether tho priests have acted
properly In prohibiting n religious cere
mony nt the Tolstoy funeral. The
Cznr thinks it was foolish."
Later, when this passenger became
better acquainted with Rasputin, he
asked:
"Tell me, Is It true that you are do
ing all the nasty things wo hear about
you nnd rend In the newspapers?"
Rasputin smiled nnd said:
"About hnlf of it, of course, Is le,
but then we are nil human, wo are
only human." i
And he laughed again,

"I know Rasputin, and I can speak
nbout him from my own impressions.
Zazonoff, the Minister for Foreign Af
fairs, brought 'this 's-alntly old monk'
to me when ho was at tho height of
lis glory a few years ago. Tho 'old
monk" dined with me, and wo had a
long discussion about tho nffalrs. In
Russia In general and about himself
In particular.
"At first ho appeared to me as a
rather youthful peasant of about 40,
neatly dressed. Ills face wns that of
i drunkard and his restless oyes, his
low voice resembled those of a mon
astery servant or a psalmist. His
speech was abrupt nnd ho used at
times mysterious expressions.
"At tlrst I was surprised that such
a half savage peasant from Siberia
could not only find his way to St.
Petersburg but that ho could And a
welcome reception at the homes of tho
very highest society. After having
spoken to Rasputin I convinced my
self that ho knew how to produco an
impression. Ilo is a natural philoso
pher coming from tho depths, almost
Illiterate, but well learned In Scrip

like a gramophone record and endowed
with natural enthusiasm.

was something absurdly wise In his
enigmatic words. Some of Rasputin's
Ideas seemed to me to bo near the stolo

and correct.
"Tho first Impression made upon

thousands of priests and priestesses, men
and women, for Russia is too large for
two men to rule."
"But how about Sister Anna Viru
bova?" I could not help asking sardoni
cally. Rasputin became confused and stam
mered, afraid that I knew too much.
"Oh, well, he is the invisible angel be
hind us all! She is supreme. You see,
to rule an empire like Russia is rather
complicated for two men," he said at
last.
I burst out laughing. The "slarretz"
glared at me. Then he resumed
fiercely:
"Don't laugh! The time of judgment
is very near. We are facing great
changes. I must be strong to accomplish
all the work. I get my strength from
women women and more women! Give
me a woman and I am young, strong and
wise. Take away the woman and I col

how to love but not women who know
how to talk. I want silent women, wom

experience, of my vision, of my divine
conviction." For a second he paused,
then said solemnly:
"Cursed be the woman who ever dares
to oppose me, for it is not I she starves
and denies, but the soul of Holy Russia,
who feeds through me!"
This appalling revelation of vampir
ism was interrupted by a telephone call
from the Grand Duchess Anastasia to
Rasputin.
"What do you want?" asked Rasputin
brusquely.
'The Czarevich is feeling badly and
his nose is bleeding," Anastasia replied.
"bring him to the telephone," com
manded he.
This was evidently done at the palace,
for Rar.putin spoke to him:
"There is nothing the matter with your
nose. Go and sleep on the chair until I
come. Let your sister keep ice on the
noae. My little dove, I am yonv guard

After this telephone conversation he
turned to us, smiling.
"Now I have to leave and I will
continue my discussion about the role
thut love plays in our life when I sco
you aguin."
He shook hands with everybody; then
addressed me.
"You need a spanking, because you
are nothing but a child in your views of
lifi-. You think me a monster and charla
tan. Never mind. 1 know your father. He
has been trying to ruin me with his
printer's ink and paper at the court and
in the eyes of the people, but in vain. I am
still alive and 1 am stronger than he is!"
He nodded slightly, crossed himself
and left. I felt as if a heavy pressure
"ifr-TiT rmB" ''mm ii
had been lifted from the atmos
phere and everybody seemed to
breathe, relieved.
I did not see him for a long time
He evidently avoided meeting me,
and Vinibova. his friend, grew cold
toward me. My father renewed his
bitter articles in denouncing Raspu- r
tin as an impostor. But it was practi
cally impossible for Virubova or Raspu
tin to put me out or do me any harm,
especially as I had the public opinion
on my side.
Some time passed and the incident
with Rasputin at the studio of Aronson
was almost forgotten. Mme. Virubova
had arranged ar elaborate charity ball
for the benefit of the wounded and the
Red Cross and I was among the invited
guests. Here I saw Rasputin the second
time. I was dressed in the Russian
peasant costume of the Volga provinces
and danced a folk dance for the audi
ence. Rasputin walked toward me and
extended his hand for greeting, quite as
if nothing had happened, and exclaimed:
"Ah, Asta, my little dove! You must
dance with me!"
Without any hesitation I answered
that I would be pleased to dance with
him, provided the hostess was able to
collect an extra ten thousand rubles for
tho charity. The announcement that
Rasputin and I would dance a number
of folk dances for the gathering brought
double the ar,ked amount of money.
Everybody was curious to see Raspu
tin dancing with Suvorina. The nvjnk
danced well, and the audience cheered
and applauded us wildly. During the in
termission I told him:
"Rasputin, this a function which you
can perform much better than ruling
Russia."
He pulled his red beard and glanced
at me slyly, grunting:
"That's all right, my dear lady It
makes no difference whether the medium
is a dance or a drink, if there is only
the woman. I make all women of
Russia to dance. Now you dance with
me; to-morrow you may drive or elope
with me. Who knows?"
"F think you wou! I I e'ter forget wom
en and think of more important things,"
I replied. For a long moment he did
not speak, then:
"If I am separated from a woman
Russia will perish! If Russia forgets mo
and forgets the woman she will perish
in less than a year!" he said. I felt a
shudder go through me. There was

It was really strange what
influence Rasputin had over
the Czar and the Czarina, yet, I be
lieve, that behind his influence was still
that very slirewd lady. Mme. Virubova.
Just as much as he was hated by the
people and the intellectuals of Russia
was he loved by the rojal family and the
court; and as he was loved so he domi
nated those who loved him and turned
their lives to serve his own purposes.
First of all, he was, above all, a virile
man of instinct, a "naturmensch," as
Nietzsche would have said. He fell like
a masculine meteor into the most de
cadent society of women tho world has
ever known. They loved him by the
scores and hundreds.
Woman, whatever may be said by the
poets, is a more monotonous and more
uniform being than man; the chromatic
.;ile of her characteristics is not so far
extended, for she is a being nearer to
nature than man is. The forgetfulness
of this fact has caused much bitterness
to the idealists who have set her In the
clouus.
Woman is less moral than, and really
much more shameless, because she
has almost always been idle which
is the fault of man, who, since the
feudal era developed her as an instru
ment of pleasure. This moral aspect of
the psychology of woman being granted,
it at once explains her preference and
her affinity for those men who represent
the primitive animal type. Such a man
was Rasputin.
Besides that, he had acquired on his
extended pilgrimage from one monas
tery to another a tinge of mystic incli
nation, which, with natural Intuition, he
knew how to exploit most effectively in
his dealings with women. He knew the
psychology of women better than the
best psychologists and poets, and he
played on them accordingly. This, my
view of him, was corroborated by his in
timate friend, Anna Virubova, in one of
her conversations with me, when she
said:
"Brother Gregory dominates all his
women friends, including the Czarina.
He is a wise man of the East, and
knows that an average educated man
is a moralizing animai, which is his
weakness in lii:J relation with woman. It
would be better if he were to make up
his mind and find out which is the mora
ign I ible to hint: the woman who is vo
luptuous, beautiful and fascinating, tho
instrument of pleasure, or the woman
m the higher and more noble sense of
the word. Instead of eitl or of thcae, he
chooses the proud woman, charming and
playful, and would like to teach her
morality, instead of pro iding him;elf
with a whip, a i'- wise old woman ad
vised Zarathustra; he longs for the vo- H
lupiuous woman aud forgets that fhe has
poisonous teeth and finger nails." H
I douijt that Rasputin could have ex- H
erciied tho power at the court as he did H
had he dot been oacked up and manipu-
lated bo by silent Anna. But what her H
motives wera in doing so is a mystery.
Either she was ttnxious to ruin the H
zari::3 through Rasputin's infiuenca H
and take her place or she was an agent H
of dark powers. H
There have been ugly rumors that
she was a tool of the Geirnan General
Staff and the Kaiser. It has been hint-
ed that a certain German baroness, who H
visited her frequently during the rule of
the Czar, called on her with Mme.
Trotzky. when th. Bolsheviks appeared
in Petrograd. and assured her that she
would remain immune in her private S
illa und no one would touch her per-
ional property, jewels and money.
Such generous immunity was not
granted to any other favorite of the court fl
and it would seem as if she could have H
obtained it only through some such meads I
as gossip hints at.
One of Rasputin's tricks of controlling
the Czarina and other women of position
was his doctrine of "hlysticism"
a "religion," which emphasizes the fact
tnat sensualism is the main point cf a
religious ritual and sensuous symbols
are to be considered as sacred Bigns of
devotion. I was told that he had a real
Hlysty chapel in the house of Mme. Vi
rubova, where special services were cele
brated frequently for her and a
few of her intimate friends, but I nevr
saw it.
In these pages next Sunday I will
give some surprising details about thla
strange doctrine of "Hlysticism" and
the very ingenious way Rasputin hid a
disgusting sensualism behind the solemn
symbols of religion. It was very largely
through his preaching and practice of
this doctrine that the monk became the
sinister figure he did under Russia's old
regime.

Th** II (Miotic Rasputin, Who, Just Preowl
ing Ills Own Murder, Wm Amusing Himself
by Writing About Jack, the Ripper.
“Such are the true facts of the Jack, the Rip
jH*r mystery, which may ever puzzle those who do
not read my book.”
Unless Uodachenko’s eventual incarceration in
an asylum be taken to indicate that he W’as raving
mad at the height of his terrible career, this amaz
ing account leaves wide open the whole question
of his motivation.
Even supposing he w-as mad, one still wonders
what sort of madness could have spurn'd him to
such extremes of bestiality and. at the same time,
have left him enough cunning wholly to escape
detection by Scotland Yard.
The condition of his victims made it obvious
that immediately after each crime he must have
tK*en covered with blood. Rasputin says he lived
with his sister far from his hunting field How
then, in his gory state, did he get home undetected?
Moreover, what of this same sister, who must
known something of his activities and “the
woman?” To have helped in the grue
some work, they must have been as mad as he.
And is it likely that a whole menage of lunatics
would have failed to attract attention?
Yet, silent as Rasputin remains on these signif
icant points, sketchy as his story is, he never
theless writes with an accent of truth—an accent
which becomes even more pronounced when it is
recalled that, through his friendship with Proto*
I*>poff, the wily Minister of the Interior, he had
THK AIHKRMAX WKKKLY
free access to the files
of the Secret Police.
Also, on the affirmative side is
the fact that Scotland Yard sus
pected that the cards, with which
they were playfully kept informed
of forthcoming murders, were
w-ritten by a woman. If Mrs., or
Miss, Win berg played the role Ras
putin assigns her, their suspicion
would seem to be confirmed.
And Pedachenko’s former em
ployment on the staff of a mater
nity hospital is illuminating, too,
for it explains the considerable
skill which the killer displayed in
the art of evisceration.
In all. Jack, the Ripper, com
mitted six murders in a little less
than a year. Each took place in
the same quarter of London and
in each case the victim was a wo
man of the streets.
Following the second, police re
ceived the following card, signed
with this pseudonym:
“Dear Boss: I keep on hearing
the police had caught me but they
won’t fix me yet. I love my work and
want to start again. You will soon
hear of me and my funny little game.
The next job I shall clip the body’s
ears off and send to police officers,
just for jolly, wouldn’t you?”
Four days later, the mutilated
body of Elizabeth Stride, known as
l>ong Liz, was discovered in an alley,
her throat cut, a bunch of grapes in
her hand. While the shopkeeper, who
had sold the grapes to her, and “a dark
man with a moustache” were Identifying
the body, another woman's corpse was
found in another alley, close by.
The other victim, Catherine Eddowes,
also had her throat cut. In addition, her
eyelids had been slit and one of her
kidneys removed. The kidney subsequently
reached the police, through the mails, along
wdth this message:
“I wasn’t codding, dear old Boss, when I gave
you the tip. You’ll hear about saucy Jack’s work
tomorrow. Double event this time. Number one
squealed a bit. Couldn’t finish straight off. Had
no time to get ears for police. Thanks for keeping
last letter back till I got to work again.”
Meanwhile, London was in an uproar. Women
feared to appear alone on the streets after dark.
The police combed Whitechapel, made numerous
arrests and even
dressed members of
the force as women.
The only effect
was a fifth murder,
this one a master
piece of brutality.

communications troubled the police, no more
murders bore Jack’s peculiar trademark.
But the panic kept up.
Then, on July 18, the killer took his sixth
and last victim. Her body, like those of the
first four, was found in an alley. After that
the case of Jack, the Ripper, was consigned
to the pages of history, detective stories and
Rasputin’s book.
It is not unlikely that the monk w-as at
work on his manuscript on the fateful De
cember night in 1916, when he was sum
moned to the Palace of Prince Yussopov.
The first World War was then in prog
ress, and Russia was at the breaking point.
Rasputin, son of a poor peasant (whose
name meant “debauchee") had by means of
his hypnotic powers and lure of the evan
gelistic gospel he preached, raised himself
to a position of tremendous influence at the
court of Nicholas 11.
Believing him their ow n and their coun
try’s evil genius, four members of the aris
tocracy, Yussopov, Vladimir Puriskevitz.
Grand Duke Dmitri and Sukhotin, resolved
to liquidate him. They baited their trap by promis
ing him the favors of a titled beauty, and Raspu
tin rushed to an expected conquest.
It w-as, but not the beauty’s. In fact, there was
no beauty. But before the monk suspected trick
ery he had. been persuaded to partake of cakes
and wine, containing cyanide of potassium.
Following the repast, he confessed to a slight
burning sensation In the stomach. Otherwise he
seemed to suffer no discomfort.
Despairing of the effects of poison on such a
constitution, one of the conspirators shot him.
“There was a roar as from a wild beast,” Yus
sopov wrote later, “and Rasputin fell backward.”
After concluding that their victim was dead,
three of the conspirators retired upstairs, leaving
the Prince alone in the murder room.
“I cannot explain why,” Yussopov’s account of
the night continues, “but suddenly I seized him by
both arms and violently shook him. The body
rose, leaned sidewise and fell backward into its
former position, the head hanging lifelessly to
one side.
“I stood over him for a little while and was
on the point of going away when my attention was
arrested by a slight trembling of the left eyelid. I
bent down and attentively examined his face. It
began to twitch convulsively. The movement be
came more pronounced. Suddenly the left eye
half opened. A moment later the right lid trem
bled and lifted. And both eyes, the eyes of Ras
putin, greenish and snake-like, fixed themselves
on me with an expression of devilish hatred.
“My blood froze in speechless horror. I wanted
to run, to call for help, but my feet would not
move and no sound came from me. I stood riveted.
“Then the incredible happened. With a violent
movement, Rasputin got to his feet. I was horror
stricken. The room resounded with a wild roar.
His fingers convulsively knotted, flashed through
the air. Like red hot irons they gripped my
shoulder and tried to grip me by the throat. His
eyes were crossed and protruded terribly. He was
foaming at the mouth, and inla hoarse whisper he
constantly repeated my name.
“I tried to tear myself away, but a terrible
struggle ensued. This poisoned and wounded crea
ture, raised by the powers of darkness, inspired me
with a feeling so terrifying, so ghastly, that the
memory of it haunts me to this day.”
Finally he managed to shake off the monk,
rushed upstairs and called to his friends, “He’s
alive!” He seized a loaded stick when he saw
Rasputin making his way to the door and bellow
ing like a wounded animal. He reached the street,
and there the conspirators closed in again.
Four more shots from Puriskevitz’s revolver,
and a vigorous beating with the loaded stick were
required to finish the business the poison had
begun. Yussopov fainted. His three companions
threw- the dead monk into the Neva River, and
thus ended the almost indestructible Rasputin.

aivcrsally detested all over Russia, that it wai
ain alive so long a time after it had been found
scene by other than violent means."
S
S A rule the general public knows very little concerning these
A gects, but I shall quote here a passage out of a book on Russia by
Sir Donald Mnckenzio Wallace, which is considered to this day as a
itandard work in regard to its subject. "Among the 'Khlysty, he
writes, "there are men and women who take upon themselves the
calling of teachers and prophets, and In this character they lead a
itrict, ascetic life, refrain from the most ordinary and innocent
pleasures, exhaust themselves by long fasting and wild ecstatic reli
ious exercises and abhor marriage. Under the excitement caused
If their supposed holiness and inspiration, they call themselves not
only teachers and prophets, but also Saviours, Redeemers, Christs,
Mothers ,of God. Generally speaking, they call themselves simply
I ods and pray to each other as to real gods and living Christs and
jjtdonnas. When several of these teachers come together at a
i meeting they dispute with each other in a vain, boasting way as to
which of them possesses most grace and power. In this rivalry they
lometimes give each other lusty blows on the car, and he who
bears the blows the most patiently, turning the other cheek to the
miter, acquires the reputation of having tho most holiness.
"Another sect belonging to the same category and which indeed
claims close kindred with it is the Jumpers, among whom the erotic
element is disagreeably prominent. Hero is a description of their
religious meetings, which are held during summer in a forest and
during winter in some outhouse or barn. After due preparation
prayers are read by the chief teacher, dressed in a white robe and
itanding in the midst of the congregation. At first he reads in an
ordinary tone of voice and then passes gradually into a merry chant.
When he remarks that the chanting has sufficiently acted on tho
(hearers he begins to jump. The hearers, singing likewise, follow
hi example. Their ever-increasing excitement finds expression in
the highest possible jumps. This they continue as long as they can
men and women aliko yelling like enraged savages. When all are
thoroughly exhausted the leader declares that he hears the angels
ringing, and then begins a scene which cannot be here described."
I have quoted this passage in full because it may give to tho
reader who is not versed in the details of Russian existence and
Russian psychology tho key to the circumstances, that helped Ras
putin to absorb for such a considerable number of years the attention
of the public in Russia, and which, in fact, made him possible as a
great ruling, though not governing, force in the country. In some
ways he had appealed to the two great features of the human char
acter in general and of the Russian character in particular mys-
ticism and influence of the senses. It is not so surprising as it might
I leem at first sight that he contrived to ascend to a position which
no one who knew him at first ever supposed he would or could attain.
At the same time I must, in giving a brief sketch of the career
of this extraordinary individual, protest against the many calumnies
I .which have associated him with names which I will not mention here
i out of respect tnnd feelings of patriotism. It is sufficiently painful
to)we to say-so, but German calumny, which spares no one, has
used its poisoned arrows also where Rasputin came to be discussed.
I It lias tried to' travesty maternal love and anxiety into something
quitdifferent, andft has attempted to sully what it could not touch.
There have bce.fi many sad episodes in this whole story of Rasputin,
(but some of ttlcTeRple who have been mentioned in connection with
i .them were commeiely innocent of the things for which they have
"been reproaenecr. Finally, the indignation which these vile and
unfounded accusations roused in the hearts of the true friends and
J servants of t5o people led to the drama which removed forever from
t the surface of Russian society the sectarian who unfortunately had
Kmtrived to glide into its midst.
Rasputin a Master of Corruption
The one extraordinary thing about Rasputin is that he was not
t iiurdered sooner. He was so entirely despised and so universally
tyeated all over Russia that it was really a miracle that he could
remain alive so long a time after it had been found impossible to
remove him from the scene of the world by other than violent means.
It;was a recognized fact that ho had had a hand in all kind of dirty
1 $ny matters and that no business of a financial character con-
oecfed with military expenditure could be brought to a close with
l out his being mixed In it. About this, however, I shall speak later
I fto fn trying to explain how the Rasputin legend spread and how it
k ya's exploited by all kind of individuals of a 'shady character, who
5f.J VI. -j! iL.! ml.- J-1 l.J
u ins numo ior purposes 01 tneir own. xne ucanuai tuuucvieu
with the shameless manner in which he became asspciated with
Innumerable transactions more or less disreputable was so enormous
that unfortunately it extended to people and to names that should
I .neyer, have been mentioned together with him.
It must never be forgotten, and I cannot repeat this suffi
ciently, that Rasputin was a common peasant of the worst class
of the Russian mougiks, devoid of every kind of education, with
out any manners and in his outward appearance more disgusting
jhan nn thing else. It would be impossible to explain the
influence which he undoubtedly contrived to acquire "upon some
persons belonging to the highest social circles if one did not take
into account this mysticism and superstition which lie at the
bottom of the Slav nature nnd the tendency which the Russian
character has to accept as a manifestation of the power of the
divinity all things that touch upon the marvelous or the uncx
plainablc. Rasputin in a certain sense appeared on the scene of
Russian social life at the very moment when his teachings could
become acceptable, at the time when Russian society had been
shaken to its deepest depths by the revolution which had fol
lowed upon the Japanese war and when It was looking every
where for a safe harbor in which to find a refuge.
At the beginning of his career and when he was introduced into
the most select circles of tho Russian capital, thanks to the caprices
and the fancies of two or three fanatic orthodox Indies who had
imagined that they had found in him a second Savonarola and that
his sermons nnd teachings could provoke a renewal of religious fer
vor, people laughed nt him and at his feminine disciples, and made
all kinds of jokes, good nnd bad, about him and them. But this sort
of thing did not last n long time and Rasputin, who, though devoid
of every kind of culture, had a good deal of the cunning, which is one
of the distinctive features of tho Russian peasant, was the first to
who made I nat nt last Rasputin himself
deemed it advisable i. native village of Pokrowskoie,
in "Siberia. A few days after his departure the little Grnnd Duke fell
soriously ill nnd his mother became persuaded that this was a pun
ishment for her having allowed tho vngrant prenchcr to bo sent
nwny. Rasputin was recalled, nnd after this no one ever spoke
again of his being removed anywhere. From that time all kind of
adventurers began to lay siege to him and to do their utmost to gain
an introduction.
Rasputin and the "Fair Ladies"
Russia was still the land where n court favorite was all-powerful,
and Rasputin was held ns such, especially by those who had some
personal interest in representing him ns the successor to Menschl
kolT under Peter the Great, Diren under the Empress Anne nnd
Orloff under Catherine II. He acquired a far greater influence out
side Tzarskoie Selo than he ccr enjoyed in the imperial residence
itself, and he made the best of it, boasting of a position which in
reality he did not possess. The innumerable state functionaries, who
in Russia unfortunately nlwnys have the last word to say every
where and in everything nnd whose rapacity is proverbial, hastened
to put themselves nt the service of Rnsputln and to grant him every
thing which he asked, in the hope that in return he would make him
self useful to them.

guess all the possibilities which this sudden "engouement" of influ
ential people for his person opened out before him nnd to what use it
could bo put for both his ambition and his inordinate love of money.
He began by exacting a considerable salary for all the prayers which
he was supposed to say at the request of his worshipers, and of all
the ladles, fair or unfair, who had canonized him in their enthusiasm
fQr all the wonderful things which he was continually telling them.
He was eloquent in a way and at the beginning of his wonderful
thaumaturgic existence had not yet adopted the attitude which he
was to assume 'nter on of an idol, whom every one had to adore.
t IIe was preaching the necessity to repent of one's sins, to
make due penance for them after a particular manner, which
he described as being the most agreeable to God, and to pray
s constantly and with unusual fen or for the salvation of orthodox
Russia. He contrived most cleverly to play upon the chord of
patriotism which Is always so developed in Russians, and to
speak to them of the welfare of their beloved fatherland when
ever he thought it advantageous to his personal interests to do so.
He succeeded in inspiring in his adepts a faith in his own person
and in his power to save their souls akin to the one which is to
be met in England and in America among the sect that preach
mental heading. A few hysterical ladies- who were addicted to
neuralgia or headaches, suddenly found themselves better after
having conversed or prayed with him, and they spread his fame
outside the small circle which had adopted him at the beginning
of his career. One fine day a personal friend of the reigning
Empress, Madame W.r introduced him at Tzarskoie Selo, under
the pretext of praying for the health of the small heir to the
Russian throne, who was occasioning some anxiety to his par
ents. It was from that day that he became a personage.
His success at court was due to the superstitious dread with
which he contrived to inspire the Emprpss in regard to her son. She
was constantly trembling for him, and being very religiously inclined,
with strong leanings toward mysticism, she allowed herself to be
persuaded more by the people who surrounded her than by Rasputin
himself. She believed that the monk, of whose holiness she was
absolutely persuaded, could by his prayers alone obtain the protec
tion of the Almighty for her beloved child. An accidental occurrence
contributed to strengthen her in this conviction. There were per
sons who were of the opinion that the presence of Rasputin at
Tzarskoie Selo was not advantageous for many reasons. Among
them was Mr. Stolypine, then Minister of the Interior, and he it was
A kind of bargaining established itself between people desirous
of making a career nnd Rasputin, eager to enrich himself no matter
by what means. He began by playing the intermediary in different
financial transactions agninst n substantial consideration, and at
last he thought himself entitled to give his attention to matters
of state. This was the saddest side of his remarkable career
as a pscudo-Cagliostro. He had a good deal of natural intelligence,
and while being tho first to laugh at fair ladies who clustered
around him, he understood at once that he could make use of them.
This he did not fail to do. He adopted toward them the manners
of a stein master, and treated them like his humble slaves. At
last he ended by leading the existence of a man of pleasure, denying
himself nothing, especially his fondness for liquor of every kind.
At that time there was ,no prohibition in Russia and, like all
Russinn peasants, Rasputin was very fond of vodka, to which
he never missed adding a substantial quantity of champagne when
ever he found tho opportunity.
I shall abstain from touching upon the delicate point of the
orgies to which it is related that Rasputin was in the habit of
addicting himself, the more so because I do not really believe these
ever took place in those higher circles of society where it was
said they regularly occurred. That strange things may have
happened among the common people, who in far greater numbers
than it has ever been known used to attend the religious meetings
which he held, I shall not deny. It must nlways be remembered
that Rasputin belonged iO the religious sect of the Khlysty, of
whose assemblies we have read the description, and it is quite likely,
and even probable, that the assemblies of these sectarians nt which
he presided were not different from the others to which these
heretics crowded. But I feel absolutely convinced thnt as regards
the relations of the ndventurcr with the numerous Indies of society
silly enough to believe in him and in his gifts of prophecy, these
consisted only of superstitious reverence on one side and exploitation
of human stupidity on tho other.
I must once more insist on the point that the apparition of
Rasputin in Russian society had nothing wonderful about it, and
thnt the only strange thing is that such a fuss was made. Before
his time people belonging to the highest social circles had become
afflicted with religious mnnias of one kind or another out of that
natural longing for something to believe in and to vvoiship which
lies hidden at the bottom of the character of every Russian who
has the leisure, or the craving, to examine teriously tho difficult
RASPUTIN AND THE RUSSIAN, CHARACTER
TT WOULD be impossible to explain the influence which Rnsputln
undoubtedly contrived to acquire upon some persons belong
ing to the highest social circles if one did not take Into account
this lnvsticlsm nnd superstition which lie at the bottom of the
Slav nature and the tendency which the Russian character hM
to accept as a manifestation of the power of the divinity all
things that touch upon the marvelous or the uncxplainablc.
and complicated problems of n future life and of the faith one
ought to follow and to believe in.
In 1817 there was discovered in the very heart of St. Petersburg,
holding its meetings in an imperial residence (the Michael Palace),
n religious sect of most pronounced mystical tendencies, presided
over- by n lady belonging to the best circles of tho capital the
widow of u colonel, Mndamo Tntarinoff. In her apartments used
u gnther officers, State functionaries, women and girls of good
fnmily nnd excellent education who, with slight variations, practiced
all tho religious rites of the Khlystys. One of the Minister! of
Alexander I, Prince Galitzyne, was suspected of having honored
these assemblies with his presence. Thanks to a letter which
accidentally fell into the hands of the police, the Government became
iiware of what was going on, and Madame Tatarinoff, this Russian
Madame Guyon, expintcd in exile in a distant province of Siberia
the ecstasies which she had practiced nnd which she hnd allowed
others to practice under her roof. Some of her disciples were
prosecuted, but the greater number escaped scot free. The authorities
did not care to increase the scnndal which this affair hnd aroused
in the capitnl.
Uplifting the Cab Drivers
Much later, in 1878, after the Russo-Turkish war, which, like
the Japanese affair, had been followed by a strong revolutionary
movement in the country that culminated in the assassination of
the Czar, Alexander II, another prophet, this time of foreign origin,
nppenred on the social horizon of St. Petersburg society, where he
made a considerable number of converts. This was the famous
Lord Raditock, whose doctrines were taken up by a gentleman who
up to thnt time had been known as one of tho gayest among the
gny, a colonel in the Gunrds Mr. Bnsil Paschkoff. He was
enormously lich, and put all his vnst fortune nt the service of the
religious craze which had seized him. He used hls best efforts
to convert to tho doctrino of salvation through faith only not alone
hia friends and relatives, but also the poorer classes of the popu
lation of tho capital, devoting in particular his attention to the
cab drivers. All these people used to meet at his house, where
they mingled with persons of the highest rank and standing, such
ns Count Korff, nnd a former Minister, Count Alexis Bobrinsky.
Later on the whole Tchertkoff family, to which belonged the famous
friend, of Count Leo Tolstoy, associated itself with them, and,
indeed, displayed the greatest fanaticism in regard to its par
ticipntion in the doctrines of the new sect.
The Paschkowitcs, as they came to be called, had nothing at
all in common with tho Khlystys. Their morals were absolutely
unimpeachable, and what they preached wa3 simply the necessity
to conform one's existence to the teachings of the Gospel, which
they explained nnd commented upon, each person according to his
own light. They were Protestnnts in a certain sense, inasmuch
as their views were distinctly Protestant ones. But they had much
more in common with the nonconformists than the real followeis
of Luther or of Calvin. They were a kind of refined Salvation
Army, if this expression can be forgiven me; though they never
acquired the importance, nor did the good which the latter has done,
perhaps because they could never make any practical application
of the principles and of the idens which animated them. But at
one time the Paschkowist craze was just ns strong as the Rasputin
one became later on, and Lord Radstock and Mr. Paschkoff wero
considered just as much prophets among their own particular circle
as was Rasputin nmong the fanatical ladies who had-taken him up.
These crises of religious mania are regular occurrences in Rus
sian higher social circles when unusually grave circumstances arrive
to shake their equanimity. Seen from this particular point of view,
the apparition of Rasputin nnd the importance which his personality
acquired in the life of the Russinn upper classes present nothing
very wonderful. Before him other so-called prophets had kept tho
attention of the public riveted upon their doings and their actions.
What distinguished his short passage was the fact that it was
made the occasion by the natural enemies of the empire, consisting
of the discontented at home and of the Germans outside the frontier,
to discredit the dj nasty as well as those whose life was spent in its
immediate vicinity and to present this figure of the vagrant half
monk and half-layman. He preached a new revelation to those
foolish enough to listen to him, representing himself as of almost
gigantic importance, who could at his will and fancy direct the
course of public affairs and lead them wherever he wanted.
My object in this study will be to show Rasputin for what he
really was, and in retracing the different vicissitudes of his strange
career not to give way to the many exaggerations, which, in familiar
izing people abroad with his person and with his name, have made
out of him something quite wonderful, and almost equal In power
with the Czar himself. It is time to do away with such legends and
to bring Rasputin back to his proper level a very able and cunning,
half-cultured peasant, who owed his successes only to the fanaticism
of the few, and to the interest which many had in dissimulating
themselves behind him, in order to bring their personal wishes to a
successful end. It Is not Rasputin who performed most of the
actions put to his credit. It was those who influenced him, who
pushed him forward and who, thanks to him, became both rich and
powerful. He has disappeared. I wish wo could be as sure that
they have disappeared along with him.

CZAtt NICHOLAS AND GREGORY RASPUTIN. WHOSE POWEIt OVER
the WEAK .MONARCH LED TO THE LATTKITS DOWNFALL AND
New Volk. I;>■ MuilA—To the in

monk and mystic, the former czar of
Russia cap attribute thé revolt which
has brought into.being a new Russia.
Gregory'Rasputin it is a name that
Russian progressives hate with the
utmost vigor. Rasputin is dead, a
victim of -assassination, but the whirl
wind he sowed did not die with him.
The whirlwind overturned a rock
ribbed dynasty that the efforts of
patriots had been unable to shake in
the slightest.
The rodk foundation of the Ro
manoffs owes its disintegration to the
teachings and "rituals" of Raspulin,
the most '>powerful man in Russia in
recent years, the "power behind the
throne" and the "confidant of the
czarina."
No one knows Rasputin better than
Sergius Mlchaelow Trufanoff, who but
a few years ago as Iliador, the Mad
Monk of Russia, was a factor himself
in Russian court affairs and who re
cently wrote a serial of his life for
the Jewish newspaper, the Wahrheit.
Russia Before the "Deluge."
In hla serial Iliador has drawn a
striking picture of the Russia "before
the deluge." It is a picture that de
picts the degeneracy of the Russian
court, of the unheeded voices of the
people asking for food and justice, of
graft and license on every side, of a
czar—weak-kneed, foolish, pitiful, the
tool of his sycophants, believer in mys
ticism—and in the center of this most
dramatic stage of centuries stood Ras
putin, the untutored, unkempt, re
ligious mystic from Siberia, who by
his hypnotic power over the czar and
czarina. Was able to make and un
make ministers, laugh at the holy
synod, force Russia into war and all
böt succeed in making a separate peace
with Germany.
Iliador, first favored by Rasputin,
"discovered the real monster Rasputin
was" and then fought him to the fin
ish. But Rusputln won, and Iliador
fled to this country.
Probably the most surprising tiling
about the overturning of the Romanoff
dynasty was the ease with which it
was accomplished. Hut a peep behind
the scenes with Iliador into the court
life of the czar, into the degeneracy of
the nobles, and to the czar himself, de
scribed by Iliador as a "man without a
tongue, nervous, weak, phlegmatic,
hardly able to articulate, an abrupt
voice, emitting muffled sounds like

and filled with tears"_rnay help to ex

Wielded Terrible Influence.
For years the czar had listened to
the "teachings" of religious mystics
and the hist anil the greatest of these
was Rasputin. Iliador said lie pos
sessed almost hypnotic powers and this
power first exerted itself on women
and through them to the court Itself,
One of those first to fall under his in

How strong the

b.v the fact that Iliador relates that
when his ministers had finished giving
him their opinions of weighty matters
tlie mystics would sweep in and get
the last moments of the czar's atten
tion, often reversing all that the min
isters had said. Rasputin, the.greatest
of these, was able to use this weakness
to great personal advantage and many
efforts to overthrow him were defeated
by the czar himself.

CHAPTER II
THE beginnings ui mc mrecr oi uregory itasputin arc shrouded
with a veil of deep mystery. He was a native of Siberia, of a small
f 11im in the government of Tobolsk, called Pokrowskoie. Some
L pMpl "to tnat wncn qu'to a yutl1 nc was compromised in a crime
JUch attracted some attention at the time the murder of a rich
I merchnt who was traveling from Omsk to Tobolsk to acquire from
I is inhabitant of Tobolsk some gold diggings, of which the latter
j, planed to dispose. This merchant was known to carry a large sum
ef money, and as he never reached his destination inquiries were
itarted. At last his body was found, with the head battered by
t!ow. hidden in a ditch by the high road, together with that of tho
f coachman who had driven him. The murderers were never discov
ered, but dark rumors concerning the participation of the youth
Euputin in the d,ccd spread all over the village.
Rasputin's Start as a "Prophet"
Whether it was the desire to put an end to them, or remorse for
in action of which ho knew himself to bo guilty, it is difficult to
Ity, but the fact subsists that suddenly Gricha, as he was called,
t developed mystical tendencies and took to attending some relirrious
settings at which a certain wandering pilgrim used to preach. The
Utter used to go from place to place in Siberia predicting the end
cf the world and the advent of the dreaded day of judgment when
Christ would once again appear to demand from humanity an
iccount of its various good or bad actions. For something like two
years Rasputin followed him, until at last he began himself to
I usame the character of a lay preacher, to apply himself to the study
f the Scrintures and to trv to nstnhlUfc n nrwf nt fcio i
j v. r wi.vv v ...a Wt11 UIU
f principles of which he exposed to his followers in these terms:
"I am possessed of the Holy Spirit, and it is only through
me that one can be saved. In order to do so, one must unite
oneself with me in body and soul. Everything which proceeds from
nt is holy and cleans one ,from sin."
On the strength of this theory Rasputin declared that he could
it whatever he liked or wished. He surrounded himself with wor-
iWpers of both sexes, who believed that by a close union with
him they could obtain their eternal salvation, together with divine
I forgiveness for any sin3 they might have committed during their
I previous existence.
Strange tales began to be related concerning the religious as
1 itmblies at which the new prophet presided. But, nevertheless, tho
I whole village of Pokrowskoie, whither he had returned after his
few years' wanderings, accepted his teachings and submitted to his
j decrees with scarcely any exceptions. These unbelievers were looked
jj upon askance by the majority of tho inhabitants, who had succumbed
to the "monk's" power of fascination and hypnotism. It was with
nothing else that Rasputin kept his "flock" subjugated. He intro-
duced among them the cult of his own person, together with certain
t rites which he called "sacrifice with prayer."
j According to the narratives of some people, who out of curiosity
j lad attended these ceremonies, this is how they proceeded: In the
L night, as soon as the firBt stars had become visible in the skies,
j Rasputin, with the help of his disciples, dragged some wood into
a deep ditch dug for the purpose and lighted a huge bonfire. tOna
tripod placed in the midst of this fire was put a cup full of incense
l and different herbs, around which people began to dance, holding
themselves by the hand all the while and singing ina voice which
became louder and louder as the wild exercise became more and
more accelerated different hymns, which always ended with the
pirase: "Forgive us our sins, 0 Lord, forgive us our sins."
The dance went on until people fell exhausted to tho ground
and groans and tears replaced the former singing. The fire died
out slowly and. when the darkness had become comnlete. the'
Tolce of Rasputin was heard calling upon his disciples to proceed
to the sacrifice which God required them to perform. Then .followed
a icene of general orgy.
As one can see by this tale, tho strange practices introduced
hy the seer, about whom people were already beginning to talk,
differed in no way from those generally in use among the Khlysty,
f and. indeeH. Pflftnutin mnrln Tin cnrif nt Tia nllffrrinnpn in this nnr-

alterations. For instance, he did not admit that the souls of his
j followers could be saved by a general prayer, but only thanks to

one uttered in common with him, and by a complete submission to
his will. Some persons have alleged that during tho early wander
ings of Rasputin he had gone as far as China and Thibet, and thorc
learned some Buddhist practices, but this is hardly probable, as in
that case his instruction would have been more developed than it
was. It is far more likely that during his travels he had mot with
exiled sectarians belonging to the different persecuted religious
Russian communities, of which there exist eo many in tho whole
Oural region, and that they initiated him into some of their rites
and customs. They also made him attentive to the hypnotic powers,
which he most undoubtedly possessed, teaching him how to use
them for his own benefit and advantage.
Rasputin Wins Converts
Very soon Rasputin found that Pokrowskoie was not a field
wide enough for his energies, and he took to traveling, together
with a crowd of disciples that followed him everywhere over tho
eastern and central Russian provinces. There ho coptrived to win
every day new ad.herent3 to the doctrines in which free lovo figured
so prominently. Among the towns where he obtained the most
success can be mentioned those of Kazan, Saratoff, Kieff and
Samara.
Concerning his doings in Kazan, people became informed
through a letter which one of his victims addressed to the bishop of
that diocese, Monsignor Feofane, who had shown at the beginning
of Rasputin's career a considerable interest and who had protected
him with great success. In this letter, which later on found its way
into the press, the following was said among other things:
Your Reverence, I absolutely fail to understand how it la
possible that you continue to this day to know and see Gregory
Rasputin. He is Satan in person and the things which he docs
arc worthy of those that the Antichrist alone is supposed to
perform, and prove that the lattcr's advent is at hand.
The writer then proceeded -to explain that Rasputin had com
pletely subjugated the mind of her two daughters, one of whom was
aged twenty, whilst the second had not yet attained her sixteenth
year.
One afternoon, writes this unfortunate mother, I met in
tho street, coming out of a bathhouse, Rasputin, together with
my two girls. One must be a mother to understand tho feelings
which overpowered me at this sight. I could find no words to
say, but remained standing motionless and silent before them.
The prophet turned to me nnd slowly said: "Now you may feel
at peace, the day of salvation has dawned for your daughters 1"
Another woman, who Lad also fallen under tho spell of
Rasputin, wrote as follows about him:
"I left my parents, to whom I was tenderly attached, to
follow the prophet. One day when wo were traveling together
in a reserved first-class carriage, talking about the sajvation of
souls and tho means to become a true child of God, ho sud
denly got up and npproached me, and proceeded to
clean me of all my sins. Toward evening I became anxious
and asked'him: 'Perhaps what we have been doing today was
a sin, Gregoryfimitsch?' 'No, my daughter,' he replied, 'it
was not a sin. Our affections are a gift from God, which we
may use as freely as we like.'
Bishop Feofane finally was obliged to recognize the evil which
Rasputin was constantly doing, and he bitterly repented having
been taken in by him and by his hypocrisy. He reproached himself
especially for having given him a letter of recommendation to the
famous Father John of Cronstadt, through whom Rasputin was
to become acquainted with somo of tho people who were later on
to pilot him in the society of St. Petersburg. The Bishop was not
a clever man by any means, but he had been sincere in his admira
tion for Rasputin, a fact which added to the consternation that
overpowered him when the truth about the famous sectarian became
known to him. He assembled u kind of judicial court, composed
of one bishop, one monk and three well-known and highly respected
civil functionaries, and called upon the prophet to come and explain
himself before this court as to the actions which were imputed to
him. Among these figured his jrenernl conduct in regard to th
women who had enrolled themselves in tho ranks of his disciples
But somehow the adventurer succeeded in dispelling tho suspicions
that had become attached to his namo nnd conduct, nnd ho explained
in a moro or less plausible manner tho things which had been told
about him. His leanings for feminine society, and his Invariable'
custom of bathing himself together with women ho declared to
be quite innocent things, and only a proof of his desire to show that
it wna quite possible for human beings to riso above every kind
of carnal temptation.
In 8pito of this episode, which would have interfered with the
career of any ono but Rasputin, tho famo of the latter grew with
every day that passed. Ho established himself at last in the town
of Tiumen In Siberia, whero ho hired a whole large house for
himself and some of his most favored disciples, and ho began to
turn his activity into another nnd moro profitable channel. He
established reception hours every day, when all his followers,
admirers nnd friends could come to speak with him about any
business they liked. Hundreds of people used to attend those
receptions, among them somo very Influential persons curious to
see nnd speak with the modern Peter the Hermit, who declared
that he had been called by God to save Holy Russia. In some
mystorious manner ho acquired tho reputation of having great
Influence in high quarters, whero (this must bo noticed) ho was
nt tho timo yet qulto unknown. Governors fearing dismissal,
rapacious functionaries whoso exactions had become too flagrant,
aB well ns business men in quest of somo good "geschaft," to use
tho German expression employed before tho war among financial
circles in Russia, crowded round him, waiting sometimes hours for
on opportunity to speak with him, and fully believing in his capaci
ties for obtaining what they required.
Rasputin soon became a kind of business agent and surrounded
himself with a number of secretaries of both scxe3, whose occupa
tion consisted in attending to his correspondence he could hardly
read or write and in receiving the numerous offerings which were
being brought to him dally. These secretaries, among whom figured
a sister of the Bishop of Saratoff, Warnawa, mado an immense
nmount of money themselves because no ono was ever admitted,
into the presenco of Rasputin without having previously paid dearly
for this favor. Very soon they established a tax in regard to tho
audiences granted by their master.
"Spiritual Sisters", of Rasputin
Besides this sister of Bishop Warnawa, Rasputin had another
femalo secretary, and they both accompanied him in all his travels,
calling themselves his spiritual sisters. They constituted, so to s'ay
his bodyguard, and wherever ho went, even in St. Petersburg, they
never loft off attending him and seeing to nil his wants. They
were tho channel th'rough which everything had to go, nnd without
their consent no one was ever admitted into tho presence of the
"Saint," ns they already had begun to call him.
Gregory Rasputin very often used to visit Tobolsk, where ho
was always received with great ceremony and pomp, as if he had
been really the important personage he believed himself. The police
man in the streets saluted him as he passed; the carriage in which
ho drpvo was escorted or preceded by a high police functionary, and
tho governor asked him to dinner. The same kind of thing used to
take place in other Siberian cities. In one of them the staterooms
reserved at the railway station for any high authority on a visit to
the place were thrown open to him. In another triumphal arches
were erected in his honor, while in a third he was met by deputations
in tho midst of which could be seen civil functionaries and religious
dignitaries.
How all this happened no one knew or could explain. In what
consisted the fame of Rasputin and what he had dono to" deserve all
these honors nobody could tell. But fame ho had acquired, honors
he had obtained, and whero another person gifted with a smaller
amount of impudence than he was possessed of would have been put
into prison or sent to a madhouse, Gricha, as he was familiarly
called, had it all his own way, and defied governors and judges with
an equal indifference, sure that nono among them would be daring
enough to try to put a stop to his progress or to his avidity.
Most friendly, not to say Intimate, relations were established
between Rasputin and Bishop Warnawa, especially after the letter's
elevation to the episcopal See of Tobolsk. The first sermon which
Warnawa preached in that town ho dedicated to the wifo o
Rasputin. One need not say that tho whole clergy of the town
and of the diocese trembled before Rasputin, who did not fail to
exact from it large sums of money, which he extorted, thanks to
the promises which he made but never meant in the least to keep.
During the course of the year 1909 complaints about Rasputin's
behavior increased to a considerable extent. He was once more
called before an ecclesiastical court to give explanations in regard
to his general conduct. Among his judges figured again Bishop
Feofane. This time Rasputin could not clear himself of the charges
preferred against him, and he was invited to retire for one year
into a monastery by way of penance. But Rasputin refused to
submit himself to this sentenco and categorically declined to. do as
ho had been told. Ho gave as a reason for his disobedienco to
the commands of his ecclesiastical superiors that his conscience
obliged him to resist because it would be impossible for his "spiritual
sisters and daughters" to accompany him in his retreat and live
together with him in the monastery they wished him to enter.
